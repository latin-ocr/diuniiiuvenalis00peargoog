dragged off to execution through the arena! The obvious difficulty in
the last mentioned interpretation is thev abrupi change in the description

· It seems that it might be possible to retain deducis (the MSS.
are divided) and still to understand ‘harena' os the spot where the
martyrs were bnmt; ‘and you have to mark the broad furrow in midst of
the sandy tract,' i. e. you willhave to stand as a living ‘lars’ in the line
which runs down straight as a lurrow. For a description os the tortores

158. The transition in thought is-‘ What? is a poisoner to ride about

159. pensilibus plumis, ‘on his featherstuffed palanquin.' The
Germans exported feathers to Rome, as we know lrom Pliny, N. H.
x. 27 ‘quue processere deliciae ut sine hoc instrumento durare iam
ne virorum quoque cervices possint,' and hence took the Roman name
‘pluma’ which they converted int0.‘Flanm.’ The whole passage is
most interesting. See Kiuge, Etymologisches Wdrterbuch der deutschen

168. inde irae, a reminiscenoe of Ter. Andria i. 1. 99 ‘hinc illae

natural.

Ι ants tubas, i. e. ‘antequam tuba ad pugnam canat,' a proverbial ex-
pression. See Conington's note to Verg. Aen. xi. 424.

galeatum. The Roman soldiers on the march carried their helmets ,

round their neck; and thus they are represented on Trajan’s column.
Caesar tells us, Β. G. ii. 21, that his soldiers were attacked before they
had time to put their helmets on; and again, Bell. Afr. 12, he orders his
soldiers ‘galeari’ on catching sight of the enemy.
