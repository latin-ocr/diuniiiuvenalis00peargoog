trra or JUVENAL. 27

assertion that no modest woman ought to speak Greek after she
had reached a certain age; but the gentle hint that a guest at
the poet’s table is to ask in Latin for what he wauts is unexoep·
tinnable in tone. The serious motives of Juvenal's antipathy
are admirably explained in a passage of Tacitus (Dial. de
Orat. 28-29). Tacitus makes Messala describe how in the good
old times the mother brought up her child on her own knees,
and committed its education later on to some elder or ancient
lady of the family, who never allowed her young charges to
indulge in a foul word or an indecorous act. ‘But now,' Messala
goes on to say, ‘the child as soon as it is born is entrusted to
some Greek hand-maid who is helped by some one 'or other,
not unfrequently the lowest of all the household, and who is not
even fitted for any serious service; the tender and unformed
minds presently receive the impress of these creatures' fables and
delusions3 nor does anyone in the whole house consider what he
says or does before his young master! What the ‘famished
Frenchman’ of Dryden’s time was to the Englishman‚ the
hungry Greekling was in a much more real sense to the Roman
of the old school. It was the Greekling who taught the child a
foreign tongue and corrupted the boy (Petronius cap. xi),
the Greekling who infected Roman civilization with exotic tastes,
who thrust ltalians and old family dependents from the house·
hold, who govemed the family by becoming master of its
secrets.

So strong a hatred of whatever was not Italian, though it
might act as a safeguard against foreign fashions and supersti-
tious, had its failing in keeping the poet from sympathy with a
great deal of the best moral thought of his times. Juvenal at
least was not a philosopher to whom in the language of Gibbon’s
famous antithesis all modes of worship were equally false. He
rather resembled those literary purists of France and Spain, who
have declined to leam a foreign language for fear of corrupting
their native style and vocabulary. lt was his boast that he had
never cared to read the doctrines of the Cynica of the Stoics, or
of Epicurus, and we may fairly assume that he intended the
repudiation to cover all Greek philosophy, in spite of 'a few words
of admiration for Chrysippus and Thales and Slocrates. lf there
was one religion that might have been supposed to commend
