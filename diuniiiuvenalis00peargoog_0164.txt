NOTES, ll. 11—27.

partieipial formation, meaning ‘the one nurtured,' aad its formation
is similar to that of the Greek past participle in -μενος,

22-80. ‘I um naturally enough driven to Satire by the unnatural cir·
cumstances of our sociat life; look at the effeminacy of the men, the
unnatural manliness of the women ; the arrogance of the upstarts.’

aa. Maevia, unknown; she appears in the amphitheatre fighting wild
beasts. Cf. Mart. vii. 67; Tac. Ann. xv. 32 ‘Feminarum inlustrium
senatorumque plures per arenam foedati sunt!

Tuscum, as particularly fierce. Cf. Statius, Silvae iv. 6. 10 ‘Cur
Tuscus aper generosior Umbro! Juvenal seems to have been familiar
with the whole passage.

23. nuda mamma, in the amphitheatre like an Amazon. Cf. Verg. ’
Aen. i. 4923 xi. 648 ‘At medias inter caedes exsulta't Amazon Unum
exserta latus'

24. unus, probably Cinnamus. Cf. Mart. vii. 64 ‘Qui tonsor
fueras tota notissimus urbe Et posthoc dominae munere factus eques.‘
On the scum with which aristocratia Rome looked down on upstarts
see Becker, Gallus iii. 136.

25. This line recurs again at x. 226. It is probably a parody on
Vergil, Ecl. i. 29 ‘Candidior postquam tondenti barba cadebat.'

gravis to be taken with ‘sonabat ;’ ‘beneath whose clipping shears
my beard sounded so grandly in my younger days' ‘Gravis’ seems to
refer to the wezglrt which he felt his beard lent him; it can hardly
mean ‘superfluous' as Mr. Lewis would take it. ‘Gravis’ may refer
to the sound, as ‘sonus gravis' is opposed to ‘sonus acutus,' but a
reference to the Roman ‘gravitas‘ which he thought was lent him by
his heard seems more likely.

26. pars Niliacae plebis. This ‘spawn of the camille of the
Delta‚' hateful at all¹ times to a genuine Roman, was doubly hated since
Cleopatra‘s time.

Verna isa slave born and bred at Canopus. ‘Verna’ probably
for aesna, from the root ‘vas,’ ‘to dwell,’ seen in ‘ sa-vastar,’ the pro·
bable origin of s0r0r3 lit. ‘she who dwells with the brother!

27. crispinus, spoken of in Satire iv. 1; he was made an eques by
Domitian. He began by being a seller of fish in Egypt. Martial has
an Epigram on him, vii. 99.

umero revocante. His shoulder ‘ hitching up,’ or more properly
‘ hitching forward.’ The ‘lacernae ' were light purple cloaks worn over
the ‘toga;' cf. Sat. ix. 28. Crispinus, with an effeminate movement of
the shoulders, jerked his lacerna forward.¹ Ammianus Marcellinus, xiv. 6.
ἐς), gives as some of the signs and causes of the decadence of Rome,
the love of statues, dress, and wealth; and, referring to the ‘lacemae'
here in question, he says that men make a show of them, ‘Expandentes
eas crebris agitationibus maximeque sinistra ut longiores fimbriae tuni·
eaeque perspicue luceant varietate liciorum effigiatae in species anima·
lium multiformes! Thus, if the ‘ lacerna‘ dragged too much behind,
the pattern of the anirnal delineated iu frout would disappear.
