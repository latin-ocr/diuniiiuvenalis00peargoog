the thoughts his verses express. M. Nisard, who wishes to
change his place in literature, has felt accordingly that it is first
necessary to prove that he was a sceptic and of not more than
average morality„ ‘One seems to feel that this man is indifferent,
that he sometimes works himself into a heat to utter frigidities,
that his indignation is rather of the head than the heart, and
that the core of all his philosophy is perhaps the carelessness
l of Horace with a loftier temperament and probably purer morals!
One of the justifications of this charge is found in the fact that
' the three epigrams which Martial has addressed to Juvenal are
disfigured hy impure allusions. It is difficult to understand how
anyone, who has studied' the first century of our era in its litera-
ture, can assume that Juvenal was not in earnest because one
of his friends was coarse. Martia] wrote to men as he talked
to them, and Juvenal never affects to condemn blackguard
conversation except when the minds of children are to be
, guarded. The charge against Juvenal's want of saith is
better supported by apparent evidence. ‘His scoffs at religion,'
says M. Nisard, ‘destroy all the value of the passages in which
he speaks seriously of it ;’ and M. Nisard proceeds to quote
that exquisite passage of the thirteenth Satire (ll. 4ο sqq), in

which Juvenal describes the golden ageos Saturn, ‘when Juno
was still a young girl, and Jupiter a private denizen of the caves

of Ida, and when there were no banquets of the gods above the
clouds’ Strange that M. N isard should not have recalled that
v wonderful mediaeval literature of miracle plays in which the
saints, the devil, and even God himself were freely employed as
the vehicles of the coarsest buffoonery. Was Machiavel the less
devout for satirising the religion of his times ? Did Dryden or
Swift ever hesitate before a joke because it was irreverent?

If Juvenal may be allowed to answer for himself, it will be
found that his views of God and men and life are thoroughly
homogeneous. ln religion he had a tinge of fatalism: There(
is a popular legend in Dalmatia which represents Fate as living
in a castle, and being roused every night by a loud cry that
new souls have come into the world and must have their por-
tion assigned them. Then F ate opens a golden, sssver, or
wooden,.chest and deals out ducatS, or silver coin, or stones, with
the intimation that such fortune as the new comers receive
