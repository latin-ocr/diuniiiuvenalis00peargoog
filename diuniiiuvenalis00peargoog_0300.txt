ΟΝ MILITARY LIFE: A FRAGMENT.

THIS Satire is either unfinished or mutilated, and as it falls below
Juvenal’s ordinary level, its genuineness has been doubted. As
Macleane remarks, however, it is difficult to suppose that a forger of
some ability would only produce a fragment. Resides, the satalism of
ll. 4-6 is very Juvenalian, and Vagellius, who is attached 1. a 3, is made
a butt in Satire xiii. 119. The former of these coincidences at least is
not likely to be a forgery. ’

The cast of thought and the diction, then, on the whole, would appear
to favour the opinion of those who hold it to be genuine, and the versifi-
cation seems to be eminently characteristic of Juvenal. Priscian (viii. 31
and 82, ver. 2) and Servius (Aen. i. 16, ver. 6, ii. 106, v‘er. 4²) quote this
Satire as being a genuine production of Juvenal’s. Weidner and others
havepointedoutthatthecomposition is obviouslyunfinished.forwhilethe
poet promises to give us alist of the common advantages of officers and
private soldiers, he has given us nothing but certain instances of the ’
communia commoda. The question then presents itself, was the Satire

Α left in its fragmentary and unfinished state by Juvenal, or has a portion
of it been lost? Beer, in his Spicilegium Iuvenalianum, gives good
reasons sor believing that the latter supposition is the true one. 'Ibe
last quatemion of the Pithoean MS. contains folia 72-79. the last solio
being tacked on to the end. The principal fact bearing out this suppo-
sition is that the sixtieth verse of Satire xvi. occurs in the last line of the
last page, at the end of the tenth quaternion, that is, at the end os the
whole book, as the ancients had it. And whereas the beginnings and
endings of all the other books are accurately marked, no markis
attached to the end of this Satire.

It is tempting to speculate in what way the poem was to be com-
pleted. Juvenal, if he is the author, never attacks the profession of
a soldier in his other writings, but complains bitterly that the soldier
was defrauded of his proper reward because promotion went by favour,
vii. 92, xiv. 195-197‚ or because the higher commands were poorly

- paid, iii. 132,133. It seems possible that the Satire was intended to
show ironically that all the soldier‘s gains were in certain privileges
of dubious equity. He could transfer a civil suit to a military tribunal,
where the plaintiff would not dare to follow him ; he could get justice
without the delays of law; he could will away his own property without
reference to his father's wishes; and of course his promotion is fair, for
it helps a general very much if his bravest men are correspondingly
