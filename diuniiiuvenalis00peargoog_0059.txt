the means of gratifying luxury increased. The violent and
unnatural passions stirred up by the civil Wars endured under
other shapes even after those wars had ceased. Such foreign
wars as were waged under the Empire were fought by a soldiery

their accession to office or when canvassing for office, conquerors
who aimed at maintaining their popularity, private citizens who
hoped to gain influence enough to play a public part, all sought
to win their way to the hearts of the Roman populace by pan-
