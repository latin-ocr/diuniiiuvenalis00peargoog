34. ‘These men, now millionaires, once wound a horn at shows in
country towns, and were known as “ puff-cheeks:” they now exhibit
shows on their own account, and for popularity's sake they bntcher the
man whom the mob bids by turning up its thumbs.' buccae seems to
be the nickname they got in the municipia. Is a gladiator was wounded
so that he could fight no longer, he and his assailant appealed to the
spectators. If they wished his death, they turned their thumbs towards
their breasts (pollicem convertere) and cried ‘serrum recipe! Is they
wished that he should go free, they turned their thumbs down (pollicem
premere) and cried ‘mitte‘ The editor had to decide whether the
contente or the non-contente had the majority: if he decided ior the
gladiator's death, he carried out the popular will. ‘Bucca' may be
noticed as one os the many Low Latin words which have become the
classicalwordsin modern French. It is the origin of ‘boucha' Such
words are used in lighter style by classical authors. Cf. Cic. Att. i. 12.

with the Codex P ‘ poricas ' sor ‘ porcas,’ ‘et cur non omina,' ie. ‘ and
why shouldn't they contract sor omens as well as for sacrificial swine,
ior Fortune would do it sor them Γ But the thought seems clear aud
natural as explained above: ‘They are F ortune's darlings, and may be
expected to shift and change even as their mistress‘ The reading
‘poricas’ seems to be due to the scribe catching sight of ‘populariter’
