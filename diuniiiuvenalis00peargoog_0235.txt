SA T IRE VIII.

01 Mars. Mayor takes it as a leather guard serving as shield to the
retiiardimergo, ‘and so the adversary 01 such adegenerate priest must feel
that in fighting with him he had to submit to a disgrace worse thau
wonnds or death.'

211-236. Ι1 people might say what they thought, would they not

prefer a Seneca to a monster like Nero? Were Catiline and Cethegus
the less monsters 101 their loftybirthl

212. ‘If the people really had a free choice they would surely prefer
Seneca the Stoic to his imperial murderer.’ Lewis remarks that, ac-
cording to Tac. Anu. xv. 65, some 01 those who joined in Piso’s con·
spiracy against Nero, nn. 65, had the ultimate aim 01 raising Seneca to
the throne.

²13· Nero was worthy 01 more than one parricide’s punishment; he
murdered his mother Agrippina, his brother Britannicus, and his wives
Octavia and Poppaea. The punishment 01 the parricide, as we leam
irum the Digest xlviii. 9. 9, was, aster being scourged, to be tied up in a
sack with a dog, a cock, a snake, and an ape, and then east into thesea
or worried by wild beasts. Cicero, Rosc. Am. 25, gives the reason ‘nt
repente caelo, sole, aqua terraque privarentur! Seneca, Clem. i. 23, says
that under Claudius this punishment was more frequent than crucifixion.

215. It is true that Orestes was a matricide; but this was at the
bidding 01 heaven: he spared the rest 01 his relatives3 and never
murdered Hermione or Electra as Nero murdered his adopted sister
Antonia.

221. An intentional bathus: ‘He never murdered the Epic 01 Troy as
= did Nero by writing wretched verses on this theme,' see Dio lxii. 29: cl.
for a similar bathos Pope On the Characters 01 Women, ‘And mistress
os herself though China sall.¹

quid enim, ‘sor what called 101 punishment more than this
frivolity mingled with this atrocityt’ Juvenal means to refer not
merely to his crime in publishing wretched verses, but to his affectation
in posing as a jockey or a fiddler; see Tac. Ann. xiv. 14.

aar. Julius Vindex raised the standard osrevoltin Gaul; Servius Galba
in Spain; Verginius Rufus in Germany. The latter, at least on two
occasions, refused the imperial throne; once aiter crushing Vindex, and
once aster the battle 01 Bedriacum. He was a remarkable character
and a really great mau3 01. Plin. Ep. ii. 1.

22 5. For Nero went about Greece fiddling, as Suetonius tells ns in his
Life.

²²7· He now tnms to Nero and tells him to deck the statues 01 his
ancestors with these frivolous trophies. Cn. Domitius was Agrippina’s
first husband: Nero’s father was Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus. Thyestes,
Antigone, and Menalippa were tragic parts which Nero delighted to take:
see Suet. Nero 21.
