ROME UNDER THE EARLY EMPIRE. 49

until recently, treated much like slaves, the line that separated
slave from freeman was quite distinct. The white man who came
out free was, or was capable ol becoming, the master of convicts
assigned to him3 the convict, by the fact that be was con·
victed, was liable to become, by assignment to a master for a
definite term, practically a slave. But even in such cases as
these, where the slave-owner or slave-master was separated
‚ from the slave by such broad distinctions as colour, intellect‚
or innocence, the effect was deplorable. Slave·masters and
convict-assignees caught insensibly a cruel hard nature, of
which the only redeeming feature was the personal bravery,
amounting to actual recklessness of life, which men must needs
possess who are aware that relaxed energy and vigilance means
certain death to themselves. Agriculture, alike under the old
as under the new slavery, was neglected by the ruling class:
and it is well known to colonists how difficult it was to quiclren
into new and healthy life those colonies which had been cursed
hythe presence os slaves or outcasts from society. In Rome,
however, it must be borne in mind that the slaves were not
merely os races equal to the Italians in intellect, but in many
cases superior to them. Of the Hellenes it is safe to make this
assertion. To the astuteness and versatility os Syrians, Phry-
giam, and other Asiatics, many writers testily. ll the Moors
and Getae held in the slave community a somewhat inferior
position, the same cannot be said ol the Germans or Celts.
The sight os an intellectually inferior nation ruling imperiously
a more highly gifted one is more aflecting, and excites deeper
indignation than when the enslaved race is unquestionably
inferior. The sight ol a Cossack hounding a Polish gentleman
over the Urals, or of a Legree abusing a well-educated Quad-
’ roon, excites more sympathy than that of a planter chastising
an unfortunate negr0. And the consciousness that the only
superiority in the slave-owners to the slaves lies in brute force,
must tend to add cruelty to the cruel, and to create jealousy
whose fruit is undying resentment.

Slavery seems to have been coeval with the existence of the
Romans as a people. But in the earlier ages of the Republic,
when agriculture was the task and pleasure of a free man, slaves- .
were but few in number (vid. Juvenal xiv. 168). At the end of
