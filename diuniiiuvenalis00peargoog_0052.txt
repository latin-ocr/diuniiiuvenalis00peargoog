The Codex was left intact till the time of the Renaissance in
the fifteenth century, when several new hands appear. These,
however, are of no importance.

In the sixteenth century Petrus Pithoeus, the well-known
lawyer, appears in possession of the Codex, and finishes the
so-called Comutian Commentary. of the tenth century, and
himself adds some notes to the glosses.

The handwriting of the ninth century is in so-called Caro·
lingian minuscules3 it is free from corrections; the glosses to
the beginning ofa verse stand regularly to the left; those to
the end of a verse are found on the right hand.

The Codex during the tenth century belonged to the mon-
astery of Lauresheim on the Rhine ; but its sate till the end of
the tenth century is uncertain. In that century Petrus Pithoe-
anus received it as a gift from his brother Franciscus. After
the death of Petrus the Codex was in the Oratoire of Troyes;
thence it passed to the public library of the same town3 thence
to Montpellier, where it now ie.

The importance of the Pithoean MS. was first seen by C. F.
Hermann (De Codicibus luvenalis recte existimandiS, Got-

tingen, 1847 ; Vindiciae luvenalianae, Gottingen, 1854), and by '

0. Jahn. The latter scholar in 1845 found that it was in the
Ecole de Medecine at Montpellier. M. Bertin collated the
Codex with Pithou's edition of 1585 and sent Jahn the variants.

This collation forms the groundwork of Jahn's text, which was ·

printed in the year 1848, and has hitherto been accepted as the
most perfect reproduction of Pithou’s MS. Beer’s collation seems
the most thorough and satisfactory3 and he, having examined
most of the principal MSS. of Juvenal, proposes to base a new
text on his collation.

Beer has also collated the sn·called ‘Schedae Arvirenses’
lately found at Aarau and accurately described by Wirtz in'
’ ‘ Hermes’ xv. p. 437. These contain long fragments of Satires 2,
3, 6, and 7. Wirtz conjectures that the MS. of which these
fragments remain was destroyed at the time of the Reformation,

it having previously belonged to the library of the parish churchy

Tbese fragments were fortunately used as bindings, and by this
happy accident escaped the general destruction. It is Beer’s

opinion, aster closely comparing these fragments with the
