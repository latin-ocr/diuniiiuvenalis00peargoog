NOTES‚ ll. 1—21.

Cf. Sat. xv. 126, where, instead of mentioning the Egyptians he describes
them.

7-34. Let us first discuss the advantages common to all ranks alike.
officers and men: there is a ‘camaraderie’ in the army that makes all
soldiers cling together; it is hard to get justice for an injury inflicted
by a soldier.

7. eommunia, common to officers and soldiers alike. It will be
noticed that the Satire breaks off suddenly without mentioning what
were the special privileges of either of these two classes.

8. ne. We should rather have expected ‘ut non3' but the senseis
‘this will be found your greatest privilege: don’t let any civilian
venture to strike you if you wear uniform: nay, even though he get a
thrashing‚ let him hide itl’ The common interpretation is that lines 7
and8 contain the idea ‘qaod cautum est,’ which would naturally be
followed by ‘ne’

togatus. Properly applied toa Roman citizen; a provincial who
was not a civis Romanus would be called ‘ paganus!

10. The repetition ol audeat is emphatic. ‘Dares say 12 why he
dares not even go to the praetor with the marks os his violence upon
him.¹ The victim goes to the praetor urbanus’ for justice and gets re·
ferred to a military tribunal.

11. offam, ‘the dark elot of discoloared swellings.’

12. relictum, given over as incurahle.

13. Bardaicus, with ‘calceus’ A Bardaic shoe, i. e. a centurion.
The Bardaici or Vardaici were an Illyrian tribe mentioned by Pliny,
N. H. iii. ²3· 26, and called by Ptolemy, ii. 17. 8 Οὐαρδαΐοι. This tribe
gave the name to the heavy military boots worn by the centurions; see
Martial, i'v. 4. 5 ‘Lassi vardaicus quod evocati.' An ordinary court-
martial was presided over by ‘tribuni militum,’ but as in this case one
of the parties was a civilian‚ a special tribunal was appointed sor the
case, with only a centurion to preside averit and common soldiers as
assessors. The ‘ calceus‘ is the mark of the centuriam the ‘caliga' of
the ‘gregarius miles?

14. grandes magna ad subsellia. The bench had to be ponderous
to support its huge occupant.

15. more Camilli, ‘keeping to the standing rule of Camillus,‘ who
introduced many military reforms (Liv. v. a), amongst others a standing
army.

17. ‘Scythen that the trial of you by the centurion’s court proceeds
with perfect justice; still, you make every soldier your enemy.’ The
present is used concessively.

20. ‘The whole cohort and each maniple in it (it contained three)
has esprit de corps enough to consider you its enemy, and to see that
your revenge costs you deaa’

21. curabilis seems to mean ‘requiring medical treatment,’ justas
‘castigabilis’ (quoted by Mayor) means ‘demanding chastisement' in
Plaut. Trinummus 44.
