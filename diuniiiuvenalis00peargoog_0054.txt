ΟΝ ΤΗΕ SOCIAL CONDITION OF ROME
UNDER THE EARLY EMPIRE.

THE state of Society at the end of the Roman Republic has
been sketched for us by the master hand of Mommsen in his
chapter of ‘The old Republic and the new Monarchy! We
lind at the period when Caesar set himself to reform the evils
of the State which dominated the world, a condition ol society
which, had Caesar lived, might have been improved, and a
decaying civilisation, which a succession ol rulers fashioned
after*¹ Caesar's mould might have quickened into new even

It happened, however, unfortunately for Rome, but perhaps

each modern State is merely an unit in a series ol independent
States which taken together make up the civilised world. Each ,
ol these States has developed a civilisation ol its own, and each
has a national pride in making that civilisation as perfect as
possible. Moreover it is commonly true to say that the more
healthy and enlightened are the institutions ol any modern
State, the more free and thoughtlul are the criticisms it receives
