7. Some editors understand tribuno of the emperor who enjoyed, aa
one of his honorary sanctiens, the ‘tribunicia potestas? It seems more
, natural to understand it of the tribune who, if a citizen like Rutilus
went bankrupt, had the right (⁴cognitio extraordinaria’) to hear the
appeal of the creditors. Indeed it seems likely that he might decide
upon the question whether such bankrupt should lose his freedom or
no. In this case it seems the tribune, feeling that the special office of

the ‘tribunicia potestas‘ was to guard the functione of a Roman citizen, ’

did not indeed let matters go so far, but permitted him graciously to
seli himself to the ‘lanista’

8. scripturus leges. The technical term for a gladiator’s binding
himself to a lanista is ‘sese auctorare ;' ‘leges scribere' is the technical
term for signing a contract: see Friedl'ander ii. 238, quoted by Weidner.
The gladiator had to take an oath binding himself to submit ‘uri vinciri
verberari ferroque necari,’ if his master deemed it right. See Hor.
Sat. ii. 7. 58.

‘villa opposita.’ ‘He breaks up his mother’s bust and selis it as old silver.'
19. condire, ‘to season his extravagant delf,’ a satiric oxymoron.
