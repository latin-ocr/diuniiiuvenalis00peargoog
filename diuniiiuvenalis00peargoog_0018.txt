DECIMUS JUNIUS JUVENALIS is said in a life of uncertain
authenticity to have been born at Aquinum. This statement is to
some extent corroborated by a line in the third Satire, where the
speaker suggests that his friend, who is presumably Juvenal,
may some day or other be visiting his own Aquinum. ltris

up at Aquinum in which D. Junius Juvenalis of the cohort of the
Dalmatians, duumvir quinquennalis, and flamen to the deified

The biographies prefixed to his Satires in the MSS. are as
numerous as they are unsatisfactory. Of these lives there are

1851. An eighth was published from a Harleian MS. by Riihl
in the ‘Neue Jahrbiicher’ of 18543 a ninth hasbeen foundby
Professor N ettleship in a Bodleian MS. of the thirteenth century.
ln point of Latin style, and presumably therefore of antiquity,
the best of these memoirs is that printed by Jahn as No. 1.
The author imitates the style of Suetonius, but nothis clearness
or accuracy. Of this memoir Borghesi rightly observes that
Suetonius could never have written in so unsatisfactory a way of
so distinguished a contemporary.

The date of Juvenal’s birth is unknown. lt is variously stateds Ἰ
in the three memoirs which mention the event, one placing it
in the reign of Claudius, another in that of Nero. Assuminghim to
