in a single waggon.' ‘Dum' is an old accusative=‘ diem’ (see Miiller’s
Handbuch der klassischen Altertums-Wissenschaft p. 346). Its develop-
ment of meaning may be paralleled by that of while, from A. S. lircil, ‘a
time? The Latin construction in cases of contemporaneous action
places the verb following dum in the present indicative. Cf. v. 94.
Cf. Ennius, Ann. 391 ‘Missaque per pectus dum transit, striderat hasta?
Simcox reserato xiv. 94, 95

‘Totam hanc turbavit filius amens
Dum meliore novas attollit marmore villas)
componere is the regular word for‘to pack up! Pliny, Ep. r. 18
‘se in villa componere? Carriages were not allowed in the Roman
streets‚ and so had to wait outside the gates. The reda was a large
four-wheeled carriage. See Mart. iii. 47. 5.

11. madidam. A branch of the ‘Aqua Martia' passed over it. The
site of the Porta Capena was doubtful until the discovery of the ancient
‘Columna Milliaria ’ or original Roman milestone indicating the first mile
from the walls of Servius Tullius on the Appian Way. This columna is
now on the balustrade of the northern entrance of the Piazza Campidoglio.

12. Weidner seems successfully to defend the order of lines in the
‘text as against Ο. Jahn, who places 17-20 before 12-15, and supposes
a lacuna after l. 11. Jahn states that the rendezvous of Numa with his
nymph was not at the Porta Capena but in the valley of Egeria. But
he and Ribbeck assume that the valley of Egeria was that which is
now pointed out by ciceroni as such, viz. in the Caffarellavalley, outside
the Porta S. Sebastiano. Burn points out that Canina and others have
correctly shown that the true valley of Egeria is the depression between
the Monte d' Oro and the Caelian proper and close to the Porta Capena.
In it was ‘the Lucus Camenarum,' where Juvenal represents Numa's
trysting place to have been.

constituebat, ‘made assignations:’ the verb is used with the
dative; more commonly ‘constituere cum aliquo.'

amica, contemptuous. One of Juvenal’s most marked traits is his
constant habit of sneering at the popular idea of the national religione
of Rome, and especially of Greece. Cf. xiii. 40.

14. ’Τὴε groves and shrines are let out to Jews, whose whole stock in
trade is a hamper (possibly for collectingscraps and rags like the ‘hotte'
of the Parisian ‘chiffonnier’)‚ anda bundle of hay for a bed’ The co·
phinus and fenum are noticed again, Sat. vi. 542, as characteristic ¹of
the Jews. This people was very numerous in Rome even before the
'Empire Then‚ as now, their predominant business wasrmde. They
and the Christians were alike hated on the ground that they would not,
like the other Oriental natione, admit of any compromise with other
religions. Pliny, N. H. xiii. 4 (9) speaks of ‘Iudaea gens contumelia
numinum insignis.' The Jews were expelled from Rome by Domitiam
they are here represented as renting this valley. The Muses are
ejected, and every tree in the sacred wood has turned beggar.

16. camenis. Camena=Casmena (connected with ‘carmen') is the
