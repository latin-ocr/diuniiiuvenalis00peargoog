SATIRE I.

or legacy hunters; cf. Hor. Satires ii 5. 57 and Catuli. lxvii. This
explains iratis, as they would not, as merc friends, take the legacy unless
their names were expressly mentioned in the will. The ‘friends‘ are
angry because they have no legacy‚ but rejoice when theysee his funeral. .

147. The beginning of the Epilogue of the satire seems suggested ,
by Horace, 0d. iii. 6. 45 ‘Damnosa quid non imminuit diesl Aetas
parentum peior avis tulit Nos nequiores, mox daturos Progeniem
vitiosiorem! Now we have 'arrived at the ‘vitiosissima progenies'
and things will always remain as they arc.

149. in praecipiti stetit, ‘has reached its climax! utere velis,
ie. ‘there is plenty of wind to make one soar into poetry; one has
merely to spread one's sail, and the very air which reeks of vice will
wast one ou.’

150. ‘Yes you will say there is so much matter, that it needs agenius
to put it into shape, and where shall he be foundl’ dicos is the
reading of P, and seems quite in Juvenal’s style. Cf. viii. 163 ‘defensor
culpae dicet mihi.'

151. There is chiatus aftermateriac3 cf. ii. 26, etc.

152. Domitian suppressed criticism; cf. Tac. Agr. iii. and Hist. i. 1.

153. ouius non audeo, etc, and the next line are commonly taken as
the words of Lucilius ‘which,' says Juvenal, ‘none would dare to use at
the present day.’ Persius, i. 114, expressly tells us that Lucilius satirised
P. Mucius Scaevola (Consul A.u.c. 621). It seems far more natural to
suppose simplicitas to be satirically substituted for ‘libertas,’ ‘whose
real name,’ says Juvenal, ‘I dare not mention.' The words ‘ cuius non
audeo dicere nomen' will then be a quotation from Lucilius to suit
Juvenal's particular mode of expression in this passage3 though ‘audeo’
can hardly be the word used by Lucilius in {this connection, as the ‘ o’
final would have been invariably long in his age. ,

155. ‘But portray Tigellinus and you will be bumt alive, as they
were in Nero’s time! For Tigellinus, N ero’s notorious favourite, Tac.
Ann. xiv. 41 sqq.

pone . . . lucebis, anot uncommon mode of expressing ‘si ponis
lucebis ;' in silver Latinity we sometimes find ct before the future or
present ; cp. Sat. vi. 67 ‘Vivat Fidenis et agello cedo patemo!

156. ‘You will burn amid the plne faggots in which the poor wretchcs
stand and burn with a stake under their chin: the pinc faggots which
mark the furrow in the sand.' This is the reading adopted by Mayor.
To get this meaning out of the words we must understand ‘et quae taeda'
from the‘qua' of156, the relative being here, as not nncommonly, supplied
from a preceding clause, where it occurs ina different case: he quotes
Cic. Verr. iv. ξ 9 ‘Mancipium . ..quo et omnes ,utimur et non prae·
betura populo’ The ‘taeda' then, to which the victims are attached for
bumiug, marks the centre of a long furrow. Beer, Spicilegium p. 36·
says that P reads ‘deducit'

On the other hand, Jahn, followed by most editors, reads ‘deducis ;'
¹ you mark, i. e. you will be made to mark, a furrow, as your body sl
