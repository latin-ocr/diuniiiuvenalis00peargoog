tasted, till in due time he brings us to the dead man lying out
anointed and with his feet pointed stiffly to the door. Juvenal
scarcely pauses over the accident that crushes the plebeian out

, of life and recognition, but he calls up image after image of the

, household washing the dishes and blowing up the fire and pre-
paring the flesh·scrapers and the anointing oil, while the ghost
of the unburied man sits shivering by the black river, and
cannot pay its passage to the other side. Were it possible
seriously to doubt that Juvenal wrote the tenth and the thir-
teenth Satires, scepticism would disappear before the traces
of minute observation. The comparison of the old man ¹
fed by hand to the callow young of the swallow gaping for
food ; the reminiscence of the mother ape's wrinkled pouch‚ the
allusion to the girth, and the picture of the blue-eyed Germans
with their yellow hair damped'and twisted into hurle, are
authenticated by the sign manual of the satirist who described
Domitian’s counsellors and who limned Hippia aad Messalina.
Sometimes a single vigorous word is a picture and an epigram
in itself. Scorn cannot well go further than in the epithet of
‘rosined youth' (like the ‘gommeux' of modern Paris), and the
conception of the high windows which call up a cloud before
the eye that looks down from them, is wonderfully rendered in ¹
the single word ‘caligantes’ No doubt something must be set ·
down to the fashion of the time which affected literary bric-a-
brac, and delighted to take words moulded by Cicero or Caesar
from the provincial idioms if they were expressive and sounded

’ well. In Juvenal, however, the language is never in excess of

the thought, and we must set it down to his country training or
to something in his temperament that anticipated the modern
Italian, if he employs homely terms redolent of the farm¹ and
diminutives such as flow naturally from a'Tuscan or Roman of
to-dayt It is more difficolt to prove that Juvenal, in his abso·
lute command of metre, now and‘then contrived that a cadence
should suggest a thought. On a matter of this kind the ear is
the only judge, and it is not infallible. Three passages may
