SATIRE V.

'Aliud scripturn habet Sarmentus, aliud populus voluerat.

Digna dignis: sic Sarmentus habeat crassas compedes—

Rustici, ne nihil agatis, aliquis Sarmentum alliget?
iniquae, ‘ill-assorted,‘ where Emperor and parasite eat together.

4. Gabba, a parasite mentioned by Quintilian vi. 3 and Mart.
1. 41.

5. quamvis iurato. The ‘quamvis’ goes closely with ‘iurato’
⁴ Howeve'r much you might he on your oath' nunnus: used as the
comparative of ‘frugi' which is proved by the Plautine expression
‘frugi bonae’ to be the dative of an old word ‘frugz' so that the ex·
pression will mean ‘for the good of.'

‘If‚ Trebius, you are so degraded that you can bear to imitatea
common parasite, no man would trust your oath’

8. ‘Say you ‘are starving, surely you might beg rather than play the
parasite! Is there uo quayor bridge to give you a placei Is there
no beggar's mat too short by half l’ ‘Dimidia brevior’ might pos·
sibly mean ‘torn in two,’ and thus lacking one of its halves. Quays and
bridges were known resorts for beggars, cf. iv. 115 ; and Weidner quotes
Seu. Contr. i. 1. 3 ‘Quis crederet iacentem supra crepidinem Marium
aut fuisse consulem aut futurum l’

9. tantine. ‘Is the degradation of the meal worth its price l’ The
expression = ‘tantine est cena tam iniuriosal’ and the genitive is
adjectival like that in ‘gratum litus amoeni secessus’ in Sat. iii. 4.

10. For the oum possit honestius illie nithe MSS. some editors
have adopted the reading ‘possis curn honestius illic.’ The present
reading seems satisfactory-ieiuna must be pressed. ‘Is hunger so
starved as this, when it might with more sels-respect shiver and shake
on the quay aud munch the refuse of dog biscuitl’

¹²·23· ‘The score of gratitude due from your patron is wiped out by
a single meal, and for this you are willing to undergo any inconvenience.'

ra. fige, ‘impress on your heart ;’ stronger than ‘pone’

13. ‘Yon receive payment in full for all your long services in the pastt
no thanks are due beyond?

14. rex, ‘your patron ;' as we might say, ‘the great mun?

inputat, ‘sets it down’ ‘counts it against you!

17. culcita. The ‘imus locus imi lecti‚’ called the ‘locus libertini’
The host, as Simcorr remarks, would fill up the lowest conch, on which
he lay himself, last, and therefore the discourtesy would be all the more
pointed, Weidner refers to Petronius, 38; Plaut. Stich. 492; and to
Lucian, Somn. 9, where Eucrates tells Mikyllus that he is to hold himself
in readiness to come, and to wash himself thoroughly, so as to be fit to
take the place of any of the regular gucsts who might be indisposed.

19. Trebius. The name ol the parasite, which, as Weidner notices,
was a good Italian name. Cf. Livy xxiii. 1, where aTrebius is men·
,tioued as having given up his native town' Compsa to Hannibal.

ao. ligulas, ‘neglecting his shoe·buckles :’ ligula isa variant for
‘lingua' ἡ γλῶσσα τῶν ὑποδημάτων. Weidner iuterprets the word as
