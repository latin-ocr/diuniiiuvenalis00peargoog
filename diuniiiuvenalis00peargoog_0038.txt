ΜΕ or Juvannr. 31

’ trained public speaker he ‚will sooner have a faulty construction
' than fail to call up a complete image before the eye. ln the first

’ Satire, lines 40 and 41, beginning ‘unciolam Proculeius habet‚'
and part of lines 60 and 61, beginning at ‘narn lora tenebat,’ are
parentheses which offend the taste as we read thern. Juvenal
was probably right in judging that the wantos the ‘ callida junc-
tura’ would not, be perceived by a mixed audience, and that every
fresh epigram added life and sparkle to his declamation. Latterly
this vice of amplification grew upon him. ln the thirteenth
Satire he compares the prodigy of an honest man to (ι) a boy,
or (2) fishes turned up by the plough, or (3) to a mule that foals,
or (4) to a shower of stones, or (5) to a swarm of bees pendant,
or (6)Ι to a river of milk. Itis probable, as l have suggested
above, that in some of these cases the lines were used inter·
changeably, so that the jaded sense of an accustomed audience
might be quickened by novelty. The fault, however, belongs to
the very texture of Juvenal’swork. He had to write down to
the level of what was after all a fashionable mob, in spite of its
- training in Greek literature aud its political interests; and he
could not trust himself to convey a simple thought in the ade·
quacy of a simple expression.

There was another alternative to the arts of rhetoric. A poet
might renounce the sense of proportion and trust, like Lucan, to
conceits that have the flavour of genius or, like StatiuS, to what
Mr. Merivale has called ‘the exquisite finish of successive

lperiods! The result, as we knoW, is that it is difficult to find
areally weak line in the Pharsalia or the Thebais, and impos-

sible to call either a great poem. There is the vice of unreality
about both3 obscure machinery, turgid metaphors, or the culti-
vated commonplace of poetic diction. Reading either poem we
seem to understand why it was so possible to admire them unre-
servedly. As the faultless lines were rolled off one by one, they
filled the room with a very grateful aroma of flowers from
the tomb ofVergil. The right god interposed in the right place 3
the heroes fought like Achilles or Aeneas 3 the appropriate epi-
thets for every supernatural power and every passion had been
so happily varied, that the mind was never perplexed by novelty
and never wearied by remembrance. Juvenal has not disdained
a little of this art of literary music. Here and there with a
