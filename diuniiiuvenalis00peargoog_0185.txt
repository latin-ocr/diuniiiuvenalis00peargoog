SATIRE III.

ιη. nutritus. Egnatius was born at Berytus in Phoenicia (Dic
lxii. 26), but educated at Tarsus on the bank of. the Cydnus, which
claimed to have received its name from Bellerophon’s fall from Pegasus.
‘Pegasus terrenum equitem gravatus Bellerophontem’ Hor. Od. iv.
11. η, ταρσός was supposed to refer to the ‘wing’ or ‘hocf' of
' Pegasus who fell there⁴ Tarsus vied with Alexandria and Athens in
literary activity‚ Strabo xiv.

118. Gorgonei. Pegasus was the offspring of Gorgo and Poseidon.
N otice the sneer contained in ‘caballus' ‘Gorgo’s hag!

119. regnet. A word distasteful to Roman ears.

120. Protogenes and Hermarchus. Unknown Greek intruders.

raa. facilem, ‘the goodnatured ear of his listener.’

12 3. ‘A drop of the poison natural alike to his character aud to his
country’

124. summoveor. The word used of the lictor who ‘summovet
turbam,' makes the crowd move on: thus Juvenal says ‘I have the
word to move on.’

125. His relation as ‘cliens' is called ‘servitium'

iectura, as we might say ‘the throwing a client overboard.'

126. The sense is, ‘Besides to speak the truth, the pauper cannot talk
of services or duty. What does he get, diligent though he be to don
his toga ere dawn, and to run off to the “ salutatio,” seeing that even the
praetor posts in hot haste on the same errandt' Weidner makes
‘togatus' refer to the class of rich Romans ; and would understand
‘what good can the poor man do, if the “ togatus ” is intent on per·
forming the salutatio, as well as the praetorl'

130. Albine and Media are rich ladies with no heire: the praetor
cannot make his lictor go fast enough to salute them: he alleges that
they must have been long since up, and his colleague may anticipare
him and win their favour. Weidner understands by ‘orbis' orphans
who are waiting in the praetor's ‘vestibulum ’ to claim their rights or
to ask for aid-but surely the explanation given is correct.

131. cludit latus. Here ason of freebom parents gives the wall tc
a wealthy slave: for the other (the slave) has money enough to squander
on bad characters. Weidner supposes ‘hic ’ to correspond to ‘alten’ and
says that two young dandies of fortune are spoken of ς one who walks
with a rich slave; another who squanders a tribune's pay in debauchery.
But surely ‘hic’ means ‘ here ¹ deictically ; though it may possibly mean
‘at Rome,’ as in 1. 127. P reads ‘servo‚’ which gives the sense required.

132. Pliny, H. N. xxxiv. 11, cites the military tribune's pay as prover-
bially high. Cf. also id. iii. 13.

137. hospes. P. Scipio Nasica, who, as the ‘vir optimus‘ in Rome
in ²04 tae„ received the injunction to act aa ‘ hospes' to the mother of
the gods. See Livy xxixn.

139. L. Caecilius Metellus saved the Palladium from the burning
temple of Vesta, Β. c. 241, but lost his eyesight through his exertions
See Pliny vii. 43.
