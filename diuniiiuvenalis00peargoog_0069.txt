In the hands of Juvenal the Satire keeps the note of invective
stamped upon it by Lucretius3 but, as pointed out in the Preface,
it must never be forgotten that Juvenal’s pieces are written with
a view to recitation, and therefore we can hardly expect thern to
retain such of the elements of Satura as were not suited to
arouse and stimulate an audience. Still even in Juvenal we find
that the third and ninth Satires are thrown into the form osa
dialogue; while, in other cases, as in Satire I, isolated scenes
from Roman contemporary life are introduced in rapid, and in
some cases ill-contrived‚ succession. The invective is ever
present 3 and Juvenal tells us that though he would fain have
followed Lucilius and the writers of the Old Comedy in satiris-
ing the sinners in high places of the day, yet not daring this he
must fain be content with trying how far he may go in branding
with infamy those whose tombs lined the highways of the
Capital‚ whose life he found so intolerable and so unnatural.

It will appear then that the Satura is really and truly, as
Quintilian has asserted ¹, a Roman production; that the rude
dramatic medley which was originally denoted by the word
‘Satura ’ was ousted hy the introduction of plays from the Greek
containing a regular plot: that the word ‘Satura' was then
adopted hy literary men like Ennius and Varro to denote a
medley, in which form they liked to cast their compositions3
and that the successive Satirists of Rome retained something of
the essence of the primitive Satura in the dialogue on the one
hand andthe absence of plot on the other.
