reckoned at about seven-peuce halfpenny), but, should he be
killed, 100 denarii only shall be paid for him.

The multitude of slavessemployed in the richer families of
Rome was divided into certain definite castes, and each caste
had to make itself master of some particular detail of the family
work. The subdivision of work in the rndnage of an Indian
official of high rank may serve to give some idea of that in
a rich Roman household. In the richest of these there were
almost as many slaves as there are human wants to be supplied.
There were slaves to announce the arrival of visitors: others
to wait on them. There were special slaves to attend to the

done ior the masters by the slaves there was little left for the
masters to do for themselves. Where the powers of the body
are not called into action, the will is not long in following their .

which gave over Rome’s proud oligarchy bound hand and foot
to the Caesars. ’

Gladiators.-Like the system of slavery, the gladiatorial shows
formed so completely a part of the daily life of Rome that the
absence of more constant reference to the subject is as easily to
be accounted for as the absence of an appreciation of the theatra

intended as human sacrifices to appease the Manes oi the dead ¹,
these shows were afterwards maintained to quicken into life that
manly and military spirit which the Romans rightly believed to
have been the life of the Republic. The comparative peace of the
Empire is considered by contemporary writers, and is expressly
stated by Juvenal (see vi.· 286-300), to bave been demoralising
and productive of effeminacy. Protracted peace brought a love
of wealth‘ and ease3 simplicity of life died out as riches and
