NOTES, ll. 1—22.

6. centum portia. Cf. Hom. Il. ix. 381, Tac. ii. 60.

7. aeluros. Most of the MSS. have ‘caeruleos:‘ which has been
interpreted as ‘salt-water fish’ as contrasted with ‘piscem fluminis;’
the Pithoean has ‘aeruleos’ The reading in the text is that generally
adopted. Egypt was the home of the cat, which was actually used for
the purposes of the chase. The Greeks and Romans domesticated some
kind of weasel, and applied the name of αἴλουρος to the Egyptian cat.
See Hehn p. 376. On Egyptian cat worship see Sharpe‚ History of Egypt
vol. ii. p. 23- Diodorus Siculus, i. 84. ᾗ 1, describes how the Egyptian
populace killed a Roman soldier who had killed a cat unawares.

8. ‘They worship indeed the dog, but not the dog’s mistress'
Herodotus however identifies Diana or Artemis with Bubastis (ii. 59).

9. Herodotus notices the vegetable diet os the Egyptians and denies
that they eat human flesh. Cf. Aulus Gellius xx. 8 ‘ Eam causam esse
dicunt sacerdotes Aegyptii, cur P'elusiotae caepe non edunt: quia solum ¹
olemm omnium contra lunae aucta atque damna vices minuendi et
augendi habeat contrarias!

10. Satirical. ‘What a pious race, who can grow their own gods in
their kitchen-gardenst and how scrupulous! they will not eat goat-flesh,
but human tiesh they likel'

o sanctas. The so-called accusative os exclamation, which bears
the sense os averb easily supplied. Such accusatives are found with
‘en,’ ‘ecce,’ ‘heu‚' ‘pro,' etc. commonly though sometimes without them.

14. ‘Is Ulysses had told a story as wonderful as this to Alcinous,
king of Phaeacia (Homer, Od. ix), no one would have believed his
unattested tales: but I will tell you a tale at once recent and true and
capable of being attested! Juvenal exaggerates the rarity of cannibalism
for the purposes of his rhetoric.

16. moverat. ‘Maybe he had stirred their bile, even as he went on
to tell,' ‘a lying teller of great scats? ,

aretalogus mendax. These were broken-down philosophers who
held mock disquisitions 011 philosophy; Suetonius (Aug. 74) tells us
that Augustus introduced them to his table ior amusement.

ao. cyaneae π Karima, sc. δῖνοι, or‘ Cyanea,' sc. ‘ pelage' This is the
name of the sea in which the Symplegades lie-the two islands at the
entrance to the Euxine from the Thracian Bosporus. Thus ‘Cyaneis’

may be an ablative of place. But it seems better to take it as a dative .

alter ‘concurrentia :’ and Juvenal may either refer to the sea dashing
against the rocks; or he nray think of the rocks themselves, properly
called ‘Symplegades’ under the name of ‘Cyaneae' Homer thinks ol
the Πλογκτοί (Od. xii. 59) as near Sicily ; Juvenal seems to identisy them
with the Cyanea os the Argonauts. (Munro takes Cyaneis as the dative:
the Cyaneae being regarded as the whole clitfs of which the saxa are the
component parts: thus the dative will‘be the sarneia sense as the geni-
tive.)

aa. Eurylochus and twenty·two of his comrades went to Circo,
while Odysseus remained with the rest at the ship; Hom. Od. x. 203
