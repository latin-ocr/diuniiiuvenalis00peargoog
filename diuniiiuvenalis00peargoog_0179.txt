popularity of strange religions in Rome, see Boissier, La Religion
romaine d'Auguste anx Antonius vol. i. p. 380.

17. speluncas, ‘artificial grottoes.’ The stream was artificiallybanked
with slabs of marble. ⁸ How far more real would seem the spirit of the
stream, if the water were enclosed by a green grass bank, and no
marble desecrated the natural tufa)

23. here, commonly ‘heri’ The form ‘here’ is found in Plautus, bnt
does not become common until the Silver age. Quint. i. 4. ξ 8 ‘In
here neque e plane neque i auditur! Cf. also id. 1. 7. § 22. ‘And still
this will to-morrow wear away some trifle from its scant remainder.'

25. Daedalus. It was at Cumae that he descended again to earth
and built the temple of Apollo. Cf. Verg. Aen. vi. 17, where Cumae is
called ‘Chalcidica’ as being a colony from Chalcis in Euboea. Here,
as often, Juvenal describes the plaoe by a literary association.

26. recta, ‘upright,’ in contradistinction to ‘curva senectus!

28. bacillo, diminutive. ‘A shaky stick to support a shaky frame'

vertunt. The indicative mood shows that there are particular
persons who actually do this.

31. ‘Who feel it a light thing to take contracta for building temples,
damming rivers, dredging harbonrs, emptying the cloacae, and conduct-
ing funerals. Rome is the paradise of unscrupulous contractors’ Under
the empne, public buildings were in the charge of ‘curatores’ who
were said ‘locare' contracts. Funcrals were commonly undertaken by
contract; they were sometimes contracted for by the family, sometimes
bytheState(funnspublicum). See Marq. vol. vi. p. 340. The ‘libitinarii'
at the temple of Libitina provided not merely the workmen necessary
to carry out the funeral, but all the appliances as well, such as torches,
cars, etc. A register of deaths was kept in this temple from the time
of Servius Tullius,

33. ‘And to rislr the sale of their persons under the power of the
“ hasta '¹ set up in the court of the Centnmviri! praebere caput venale
is to suffer‘ capitis deminutionem maximam! ’Τὴε ‘hasta ' was set up in
court on the occasion of contracts being entered into for farming State
property. Cf. Weissenborn on Liv. xxiv. 18. ιο. This signified that
whoever entered into a contract with the state, pledged his fortune that
the contract should, on his side, be fairly carried out: should he fail,
the state had the power to distrain on his goods, and sell them ‘sub
hasta.' If the contractor was fraudulent, he managed to set aside the
greater portion of his fortune, so that very little remained for the state
auction at his expense. The defaulter was declared ‘infamis' The
‘hasta’ is called ‘domina' inasmuch as it confers ‘dominium’ over the

‘caput’ So Weidner, following the Scholiast: and this seems to be the

true explanation. Others take ‘caput' of a slave, so that the meaning
would be ‘and become slavedealers.'
