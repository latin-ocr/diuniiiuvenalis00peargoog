ΟΝ ROMAN SATURA. 61

Lucilius. He took as his model the writings of Menippus of
Gadara in Syria (circ. 475). Menippus was a manos cynical
wit, which he employed unsparingly to emphasize the small
results. attained by philosophers and their systems. Varro fell
in with this spirit¹3 sor he was a genuine Roman of the old
stamp who deemed common-sense and mother wit more capable
of solving the difficult problems of life than all the philosophies.
He boldly mingled prose and verse, but his influence did not
prevail to oust the Hexameter, which had been settled as the
future vehicle for Satire by Lucilius for the time to come.
Horace felt himself called upon to write Satires, and expressly
states that he chose Lucilius asa model, Serm. ii. 1. 34². But,
unlike Lucilius, Horace’s satire ceases to be political: ceases in
a great degree from being personal: it becomes social. The
lover of good living and good society and rich men and popu-

larity was not likely to imperil the attainment of all that he held ’

dear by attacking any one personally higher in rank than a
music master like Hermogenes or an unpopular upstart like
Tillius ⁸. But it is interesting to note that Horace in his Satires
retains much of the old-fashioned medley. He criticises the
society and views current in the society of his day, sometimes
directly, sometimes in the form of a dialogue, sometimes in the
form of a travesty of a well-known play. ln some cases he
actually copies LuciliuS, as in Satire V, where he describes a

joumey to Brundisium as Lucilius described ajourney from
Rome to Capua.

In the Second Book he seems to have fairly made up his
mind as to the form and scope of the Satura in his hands; he
refrains from declamation, anri each piece is ‘either a scene or a
conversation.’ .

Petronius Arbiter, in the Indian summer of Roman literature,
revived the older form of the Satura, mingling metre with metre,

² The following are the titles of some of his Satires, which will serve
to show the variety of the themes dealt with by Varro: ‘ Columnae Her·

Εὗρεν allionis τὸ Πῶμα, περὶ Γεγαμηκότωνς ‘Appon μετρεΐς (περὶ φιλαρ-

yvpiur); ‘Bimarcus' (a dialogue between Varro and Manius), Ἔχω σε
(περὶ τύχης), etc. '
