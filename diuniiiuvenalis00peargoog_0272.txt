NOTES, ll. 1-47.

conquer fortune; but not less happy than philosophers are those who
have learnt to bear life easily.

ao. Weidner calls attention to the change that seems in Juvenal’s
later years to have come over his philosophy. In Sat. vii. 190 sqq. we
find the ‘felix' described as the man gifted with fine mental and bodily
qualities; here it is the man gifted with resignation.

aa. iactare iugum, ‘to keck at the yoke.'

23—38. There is evil enough in the world now-a·days: it is a pretty ’
fancy to believe that there was none in the ‘good old times!

23. cesset. ‘is slow to,' poetically used sor ‘refuses’ The transition
in sense is seen in such passages as Ter. Heaut. iii. 1. 1 ‘Cesso pultare
ostium vicini i’

a 5. puxis (nutis), properly ‘a small boxwood case ;’ here used for a
poison box.

27. Thebarum. The gates of Thebes in Boeotia were seven in number,
and seven were the mouths of the Nile. The formula ‘sex septem’ was
common to express ‘a lew!

28. actas and secula are closely united, und peior is understood with
the former.

nona aetas. Hesiod, Worlrs and Days 109, speaks of the golden,
the silver, the brazen, and the iron age. Later poets named the ages
after different metals. ‘The ancients had no metal base enough to call
any succeeding age by. The ninth ageos the Roman state is so bad
that nature would fail now more than ever to give us a metal to call it
aster.¹ Jahn, following P, reads ‘nunc aetas'

3²· ‘The noisy dole baskets applaud Faesidius,’ i.e. his retainers, to get
their allowance, applaud him as he pleads. He was a ‘causidicus’ who
hired a ‘claque ' Heinrich well translates ‘die briillenden Couverts. ' The
metonymy 1s charact teristic of Juvenal;c l..Sat xii. 83‘ garrula pericula’

satirically uses the word ‘privatus‘ which refers to one who was not of
the imperial household.

cyathos' seems a reminiscence of Hor. Od. i. 29. 7 ‘puer ad cyathum'

46. prandebat sibi, ‘ sibi ' a dativus commodi ; ‘ior himseli'‘to suit
himself? Weidner refers to Quintilian vi. 3.16 ‘Quae nuuc iuvenum
vel sibi ludentium exercitatio est? The chief meai oi the gods ol that
day was the ‘prandium‘ and not the sashionable ‘coena'

47. talis ut. In classical Latin we should expect to find ‘ talis qualis,'
or ‘tanta quanta) The process of adding new deities to the number
already existing was constantly going on3 cf. Gastou Boissier, La Re·
