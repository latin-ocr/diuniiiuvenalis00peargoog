SATIRE XV.

Volusi. Volusius Bithynicus is unknown. On the prevalencc ol
animal worship in Egypt sud its reasons, besides the authority quoted
above see Sharpe, History oi Egypt chap. i. ‘In some cases it was per·
haps the useiulness ol the animal, aud in some the strangeuess. Thus
the dog aud the jackal devoured the carcases which, illest to rot in
Me streets, might bring disease on ὼε inhabitants?

The opening line is obviously modelled upon Cic. Tusc. Disp. v. 78
‘Aegyptiorum morem quis ignorat? quorum imbutae mentes pravitatis
erroribus quamvis camificinam prius subierint quam ibim aut aspidem
aut faelem aut canem aut crocodilon violent, quorum etiam si impru-
dentes quippiam secerint, poenam nullam recusent! Cf. also Cic. de
Nat. Deor. iii. 19.

a. Different animals were worshipped in different parts os Egypt,
though there were some lew which seem to have been the objects oi
general worship.

3. pars hsce. Herodotus, ii. 36, tells us that the crocodiles were
made into mummies aud sent to be buried iu the Labyrinth near
Crocodilopolis; as was ibe ibis at Hermopolis. ·

The ibis does not really eat snakes} though Herodotus ii. 75 speaks
of it as doing so. ’

By caresul selection from the sepulchral bas-reliess we might present
reproductions ol the whole fauna of Ancient Egypt, the lion, hyena,
· leopard‚ juckal, fox, wolf, ibex, gazelle, the hare, the porcupine, etc, etc
Everywhere we find the same aptitude for summarizing the distinctive
characteristics ol a species (Perrot and Chipiez vol. ii. p. 219).

4. cercopithecus (κέρκος, cauda), ‘the long-tailed ape,’ worshipped
at Thebes, the seat of worship also of Amenoptris, Pamenophis, aud
Memnon. Here was the Memnonium, the palace of Rameses ΙΙ.

5. dimidio Memnone. Upon the site of the Amenophium are ibe
remains of two colossal statues ol Amenophis III of the eighteenth
dynasty, the Pharaoh whom the Greeks, from a similarity of name,
identified with Memnon, the son os Aurora and Tithonus, who was
killed by Achilles. The Greeks believed that a sound resembling
that ol a broken harpstring was heard at day-break {remoue of these
Colossi. Some have ascribed the productiori of this sound to the
trickery oi the priests; some to the effect of a sudden accession oi beat
to the chilled air in its crevices. Pliny, N. H. xxxvi. ξ 58, reports
ibe legend. Strabo, xvii. 1. 46 (816), tells us that he, in company
with Gallus Aelius, had heard the sound, which he did not believe was
ruiraculons though he could not say how it was produced. Hadrian
restored oue of the Colossi, which souuded thrice in his honour,
Pausanias, 1. 42. 3, in a curious passage, shows us that ffle Egyptian

scholars of his time did not identify Amenophis with Memnon. ‘The
Thebans denyt t'hat rt is Memnon; they declare that it is Phamenoph
Φαμένοφ), who was born 1n their own country)

Many inscriptions are still to be seen ou it dating from Nero to Sep·
timius Severus, attesting that the writers have heard the mystic sounds
