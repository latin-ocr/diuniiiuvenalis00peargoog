SATIRE III.

SATIRE ΠΙ.
ΟΝ THE VICES AND DANGERS OF cml LIFE.

THE third Satire appears by internal evidence to be a conversation in·
which the poet himself, designated as Umbricius and assumed to be
emigrating from Rome to Cumae, lectores the other Juvenal, who was
still lingering in the metropolis and canvassing wealthy patrous that he
might get promotion. If this view is correct, Juvenal was just passing
middle age, somewhere between forty-frve and fifty-five, when he wrote
it ; and this agrees with the reference to Veiento aspowerful, which he
was as late as Nerva's reign, 96-98; with the passage in Martial (xii. .
18), which represents Juvenal as patron-hunting, aud with his
own description of ‘white hairs just coming,' ‘old age in its first
approacbes and unbent! No decisive event is mentioned by which we
can fix its date, though the words ‘siccandam illuviem,' in line 32, have
been thought to refer to the attempt made by the Emperor Trajan to
drain the Pomptine Marshes. It is notieeable that this is one of the
Satires which contairr a complaint about the poor reward of military
service. That Juvenal really left Rome at this time is unlikely. He was
just aa unable to live long away from the Subura as Madame de Stael to
endure prolonged absence from theRue de Bac ; buthe may have medi-
tated withdrawal, and have bought his farm at Tivoli about this tirne.
Powerful as the poem is, it is the work of one who wishes to convince·
himself rather than of one who is convinced; it displays no real

sympathy with country life, and only points the moral that you ought >

to be a rich man in order to enjoy Rome. :Dr. Johnson, who translated
this poem, and who could not live happily at a distance from Charing
Cross, might have said the same of London.

The construction of the poem is perfect. The argument turns on two
simple propositions; that an honest man cannot make a fortune at Rome,
and that a poor man cannot live there sasely or happily. Juvenal is
in fact apologising for his own failure, and trying to show that after all
he is a gainer by it.

Umbricius, walking on foot after thevan which carries out all his
worldly goods, stops at the spring iu the valley of Egeria to take leave
of his other self, Juvenal, who has accompanied him thus far, and wbo
cannot make up his mind to leave Rome, ll. 1-20. Umbricius explains
that he is only eating into his capital 'by staying ou in Rome, and that
it is a place where no honest man, no one who is not a flatterer, a liar,
a pimp, or the confidant of a guilty secret, can hope to thrive‚
ll. 21-56. The real man to succeed in Rome is the Greek of Asia
Minor, uniting Hellenic talent with Oriental superstition and servility,
ll. 57-108. These men debauch the women and boys and betray the
men of every household they enter; and it is part of their system to
