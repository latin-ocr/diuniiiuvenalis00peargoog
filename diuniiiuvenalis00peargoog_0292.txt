days when an Attio philosopher was to be found everywhere, and the

This piece is not, as will be seen from the above analysis, properly
speaking, so strictly a satire as a description of a deed of excep·
tional barbarity and violence committed in Upper Egypt by the
Egyptians. .

With this Satire should be compared Plutarch de Iside 72, who
describes a civil war between Oxyrynchon and Cynopolis in the Hep-
tanomos, waged about the animals they worshipped. The inhabitants
of Oxyrynchon worshipped the Oxyrynchus fish and made it into
a mummy when it died: an inhabitant of Cynopolis was said to have
caught and eaten one of these fishes3 so the men of Oxyrynchon attacked
the dogs-the gods—of Cynopolis, sacrificed them to their fish-god and
ate them. .

Renouf’s Hibbert Lecturc, 1879, on the Religion of Ancient Egypt
pp. 7, 8, and the History of Art in Ancient Egypt, Perrot and
Chipiez, translated by Armstrong. It is agreed by most scholars that
the more educated among the Ancient Egyptians saw in the animals
which they reverenced merely symbols of the divinity. But the masses,
while joining with the upper classes of the nntion in worshipping
divinities such as Osiris and Horus and Isis, reserved their warmest
adoratiou for the concrete forms of sanctified animals, such as the bull
Apis, the ibis, etc. Nothing struck the Greeks and some of the early
Christian fathers so much as this animal worship. Thus Clement os
Alexandria (Paedagog. iii. 2) says ‘the god of the Egyptians is revealed;
a beast rolling on a purple couch’
