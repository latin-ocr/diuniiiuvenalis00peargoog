. SATIRE XV.

sqq. Eurylochus came back to Odysseus. Elpenor, aiter Odysseus
had joined Circe, caught the sound os the stir. and falling backwards,
broke his neck. He is not expressly mentioued by Homer as having
been transformed into a swine; but the ancients employed the ship-
mates who were thus transformed as a symbol of incontinence; and
thus it was perfectly natural for Juvenal to assume that he was one os
those thnstransformed.

23· vacui eapitis. cf. xiv. 57 ‘vacuum cerebro caput? The
genitive is of course a genitive of quality, like ‘multi Damalis meri’
Hor¹ Od. i. 36.13.

²5· temetum, ‘old strong wine,’ connected with ‘temulentus’ and
‘temulentia’ abstemius is he who refrains from such drinks.

26. sub with the ablative expresses position under: in silverLatinity
it often means little more than ‘in the presence oi;' so ‘sub iudioe
Sat. vii. 13.

canebat, referring to the measured utteranceof the recitations, and
by implication to the nouseuse recited in them. Cf. the use of the
modern French ‘chantem’

27. consule Iunco. This is the reading of the Pith. Ms. Clem.
Cardinali (in Dissertazioni della pontificia Academia Rom. di Archeo·
logia vi. 231, quoted by Weidner) found a tablet, according to which
Iuncus was actually consul in the year 1²7 under Hadrian. Other
MSS. read Iunio, which might refer to Q. Iunius Rusticus, who appears
to have been consul in the year 119. See Introduction p. xii.

28. super, ‘above,’ ie. ‘south of‚’ calculating from the sea. Phila·
delphus made a new port on the rocky coast os the Red Sea, nearly
200 miles to the south os Cosseir (Aenum), and named it Berenice aster
his mother. The route from Coptos to Berenice was very important
from a commercial point oi view. as it passed by the emerald mines in
the mountain range of red granite and porphyry which runs about thirty
miles from the sea. s

30. syrmata, ‘tragic trains,' here metaphorically used sor tragedy
itsels, and thus connected with ‘volvas' which is properly used oi
books.

A Pyrra, as we might say ‘lrom the Deluge down)
35. Ombi and 'I'entyra were really about a hundred miles apart;

· Tentyra lying to the north os Coptos on the left bank of the Nile,

Ombos on the right bank os the Nile a little above Syene. Thus if
Juvenal had ever known this part os Egypt, he must have iorgotten
much about it, when he calls the inhabitants oi these two towns
‘finitimi' See Introduction to this Satire p. 215.

37. cum solos, a quite un-Romau idea.

39. alterius populi. The expression is really too vague: it is of
course intended to denote the Ombites: but its very vagueness would
seem to be intentional, as is the poet felt sure that his countrymen

would not care sor such tritles. The Tentyrites attacked the Ombites,
aud were repulsed by these.
