SATIRE XIV.

With this Satirc may bc read Montaigne’s letter to Madame Diana de
Foix‚ on the Education oi Children.

Anounurvu.

Parents often teach their children to be gamesters or gluttons, ior·
getting that no tutors in after-lise can connteract the examples that the
child of seven has studied‚ ll. 1-14. Can Rutilus who scourges, tortures,
brands, and imprisons his slaves, teach his son humanity and respectrsor
the brotherhood of mant ll. 15·²4· Do you think the daughter ol
Larga, who is the confidante os her mother's innumerable adulteries, can
ever grow up chastet ll. ²5-30· lt is human nature that the example
of vice in our houses from those we reverence should be all-powcrful:
though a sew os firm and generous instincts may be better than their
bringing up, ll. 31-37. Therefore, il yon wish your children to grow up
good and honourable, let them not see in you the insectious example of
evil; il you would have them pure, keep your household and words’and
acts unsullied, ll. 38-463 revereuce your child, that you may have the
right to censure his sollies when he has come to manhood, ll. 47-58.

Il a guest is coming you put your house in order, und polish up vuses,
and clear away filth aud rubbish of every kind, ll. 59-67; is it less
important that your son should live in a virginally pure homel ll. 68-69
It is a great thing to give the fatherland one citizen the more, provided
always he is trained to manage a property or serve in arms, as the
stork and the vulture train their young to live on appropriate sood,
ll. 70-85.

Cretonius dinrinished his property by building on a grand scale ; the
son has ruined the estate hy out-doing his father's profession, ll. 86-95.

Such a man is circumcised‚ will not touch pork‚ will not render the ·

offices oi common humanity to strangers, und worships only a God in
the clouds; is it not the fault os his father who lapsed into Judaisml
ll. 95-106.

It is saddest of all that-young men who are not naturally avaricions
are made misers by their father's teaching, and leam to regard the arts
of keeping and increasing an estate as the noblest‚ ll. 107-118. The
father who thinks that contentos mind and happiness cannot be dis·
severed from wealth'teachcs his children the vile elements of money-
making, ll. 119-125. Starves the household and himself with insufficient
and bad sood; and lives like a beggar that he may die rich, ll. 126-137;
and when heis rich he does nothing but add field to field, and if his
poorer neighbours will not sell their freeholds‚ turns in his cattle by
night to eat oll' the grass, ll. 138-151. The ill-repnte of these actions
does not allect him: he will risk destitution sooner than live on a modest
conscience und a good name, ll. 152-155. Yet it was better lor health
aud peace ol mind when our ioreiathers, under Tatius or aster the Punic
