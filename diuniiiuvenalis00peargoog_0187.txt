SA TIRE III.

171. ‘Yesl there is a large part oi Italy yet in which the toga is

¹ unknown untilamanisdead.’ Freemen were buried in the toge. cf.

Mart. ix. 57. 8.

172. Everything here points lo the simplicity of country lise. The fes-
tivals occur only irorn time to time (ti quondm: the theatre itself is on
the grass: the games are eagerly looked sor (tandem): the mother, rather
than not witness them, brings her baby in her arms. All this, as Simcox
has pointed out, contrasts with Rome where the games were never-ending.
For the custom‘os celebrating these country gemes see Tac. Ann. xiv. 20.

173. Tacitus, as quoted above, expressly tells us that the old custom
of holding rural theatrical exhibitions lasted longia the country. Livy,
vii. 2, says that ‘postquam ludus in artem paulatim verterat, iuventus
histrionibus fabellarum actu relicto ipse inter se more antiquo ridicula
intexta versibus iactare coepit, quae inde exodia postea appellata con·
sertaque Atellanis sunt.'

178. The Romans, having no choms, reserved the orchestra ior the
senate and magistrates: behind this were the sourteen ‘ordines τ’ and
behind them was the ‘cavea ’ oi the plebs. In the country towns these
distinctions were not observed. The aediles sit in the orchestra; but

even they do not don the toga, but merely the tunica alba, while the
plebs dresses in the pulla.

{84 Cossus, unknown. .

185. Veiento is characterised by Pliny, Ep. iv. 22. 4, by the words

-. ‘dixi omnia cum hominem nominavi' cf. also Tac. Ann. xiv. 50, Dio
lxi. 6, who tells us that he trained dogs to draw cars like horses.

186. ‘One patron holds a festival on the occasion os some favourite’s
beard being shaved, and another dedicates his page's look to a g0d; then
the house is lull of cakes; you, the client, have to buy even these from
the slaves. Does not this make your blood boil l’

187. accipe is a stronger word than ‘capc;’ the advice is—‘Grasp at
the cakes, and as you do so feel indignant!

190. ‘In country towns you need leat none of the dangers which maket
life intolerable at Rome ; such as falling homes, sires, marauders, street
noises ; ’ sor ‘gelida Praeneste' cf. Hor. Od. iii. 4. aa.

193. tibicen, ‘a slender shoring‚’ which shoring however takes upa
great part oi the room in the strects. The thought seems to be the
same as that in xii. 55 ‘discriminis ultima, quando Praesidia adferimus
navem iactura minorem’

194. ‘For like this (so carelessly) acountry bailiff props up his falling
tenementsz’ the meaning would more naturally be expressed by ‘sicut
labentibus obstat! Juvenal is thinking oi the neglected country villas
which fell into decuy through the proprietors living at Rome. Weidner
would take vilicus as the propraetor of one of these lodging-houses;
‘ior in this careless way (sio) does he prop up the falling house, in Romc'
etc. But ‘vilicus' seems always to refer to the bailiff of a country
estate, unless indeed when used in the sense oi a director or super·
intendent oi some department.
