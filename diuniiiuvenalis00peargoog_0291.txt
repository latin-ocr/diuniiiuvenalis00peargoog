SATIRE XV.

The Ombites worshipped the crocodile, while the Tentyrites killed
audeat it. Reiuforcements coming up from Tentyra with arms, the
Tentyrites seem to have defeated the Ombites, and a man falling on the
ground was torn to pieces and eaten by the pursuers.

The Satire is as a whole so unworthy of Juvenal, that if it were not
for some vigorous lines at the beginning, and the very Juvenaliau turn
nithe conclusion, it might readilybe set down as spurious. It probably
belongs to the last years of Juvenal’s life. If we take the reading
‘Consule Iunio,’ which Macleaue and Lewis prefer, the date would be
un. 119. If we adopt ‘Iunco,' from the best MS, it might be
referred, in Mr. Mayor's opinion, to Α. D. 127. When we remember
the account of Juvenal's death in one of the Lives, ‘spiritum cum tussi
exspuit,' and consider that Egypt was the refuge of consumptiva Roman
patients (Pliny, Epist. v. 19), it will appear possible that Juvenal went
to Egypt for beerith, chafed at his exile in an uncougenial country, and
threw off this sketch of a local atrocity at a time when his poetic powers
were weak.

Auuumuur.

Egypt is noted for superstition 3 the crocodile‚ the ibis, the ape, the
cat, the fish, the dog, are worshipped, ll. 1-8; they grow tlreir gods iu
the garden and dare not eat vegetables, yet feed upon human flesh,
ll. 9—13. If Ulysses had told such a tale, it would have seemed more
incredible than the Cyclops, or than Circe changing his mates into
swine, aud the Phaeacians, unless drunk‚ would have scouted him
as a liar, ll. 13-25. But Ulysses had uo witnesses: I tell of things
that happened only lately near Coptos under the consul Juucus,
ll. 26-32.

Ombos and Tentyra have long been at fend, because the Tentyrites
kill the crocodile and the Ombites worship him, 11. 33-38. The
occasion of a feast when the Ombites would be drunlr after a seven days'
orgie, and staggering or daucing about as they reeked with perfumes
seemed too good to be lost, ll. 39—50, The empty meu hate the
feasters, and open hostilities with abuse, and then close iu with their

Ἴ lists, battering each other’s faces till they begin to be indignant that

no lives are taken, 11. 51—62. Then they take to fighting with small
stones, not such as the Homeric heroes raised, but such as the Gods
may loolr at aud laugh‚ ll. 62-71. Presently reinforcerirents come up
to the Tentyrites, swords are drawn, and arrows discharged. till the
Ombites fly in confusion, ll, 72-76. One man, falling down, istoru
to pieces, and eaten raw; those who were too late for the flesh licking
the blood from the ground, ll. 77-93. The Vascones eat human flesh
under the dire compulsion of a siege, when even their enemies pitied
them; but what man or god or spirit of the dead would refuse pardou
to such an acti ll. 94-106. No doubt Greek philosophy teaches us
