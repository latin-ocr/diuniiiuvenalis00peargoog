SATIRE XIII.

when Gallicus was prefect of the city, but it may be reasonably explained

as an allusion to a line of Statius celebrating Gallicus as the man
‘Quem penes intrepidae mitis custodia Romae!

Gallicus had theu taken his place in poetry as a representative ‘ custos
urbis?

Ribbeck conjures up rather a fanciful difficulty about the remark that
Socrates would not have given part of his hemlock to his accusem, and
supposes it to be compounrled of the statement iu Phaedo (i. 66) that
the hemlock brought him was not enough to allow of a libatiou to the
Coos, and the story that Theramenes pledged his accuser Kritias iu his
last draught. It is difficult to find any foundation for Juvenal's statement
in these stories‚ und the health drunk by Theramenes was a scoffing im-
precation which, as Cicero sayS, was fulfilled by the death of Kritias
long afterwards. Juvenal seems really to have bad a passage of the
Krito (l. 10) in his mind. ‘Is it right,' says Socrates, ‘for a man who
suffers wrong to do wrong in return, as most people affirm 3’ K. ‘By
no means! S. ‘T·hen the doing harm to menis iu no respect different
from wronging them l‘ K. ‘It is so.' S. ‘Whatever, then, aman may
suffer at the hands of others, you must neither wrong them in return nor
harm them.'

As uo guilty man absolves himself, much less is he acquitted by publio
opinion. Happily the loss of a small sum will not ruiu you, and the
disaster is no unusual one, ll.1—10. You must not let your grief be
unmanly or more than the wound warrants. Sixty years old, do you
profess to be astonished that afrieud does not give you backatrust
sumt 11. 11—18. Truly the sagacity that guards against losses is profit-
able‚ but they too are blessed who bave leamerl not to toss the yoke
when they are galled, ll. 19-22. What day is not marked by a villainyl
The age of irou is upon us, and are we to deafen heaven with shouts

with a child's mind, do you know how tempting strange money is, and
bow foolish you seem when you expect anyone to keep from lyingl
ll. 33-37. That was all very well in the youth cf the godS, when Hades
did not even exist as an institution, ll. 38·5a. Honesty and reverence
for old age went together hand iu hand iu those days, ll. 53-59. Now
if a man is commonly honest, Ithink it a memorable act to be ranked with
porteuts and miracles, ll. 60-70.

Others have lost more than you, ll. 71-74. It is so easy to defraud
when it costs nothing but false oaths swom by all that is most sacred,

ll. 75-85. Some men forswear themselves fearlessly, because they are
atheists‚ ll. 86-89. Others, because they think it worth while to be rich

at the price of such penalties as Heaven inflicts. Would not the runuer
give up his fleetness for wealth and the gout? ll. 90—99. Resides, the
