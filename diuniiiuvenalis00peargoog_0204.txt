Nom, ll. 3-32.

the breakfast spoons with which the Romans ute their early breakfast
or ‘ientaculum' and so would construe ‘neglecting his breakfast :’ but

this seems fancifnl, though the word is to be so construed in Mart.
xiv. 120. Δ
21. peregerit, ‘shall have gone through their round ol visits'

22. ‘When the stars are yet fading, or, at even an earlier honr, when the
Bear is seen wheeling round the Pole,’i. e. just before the stars begin to fade.

23. Bootes is commonly called ‘piger,' or, as in Homer, Od'. v. 27²
aaz δίων. Cf. Ausonius, Eclogarium ‘Serus in alta Conditor Oceani
ripa cum luce Bootes? Simcox takes the second alternative to refer to
the Antumn season, when Winter is setting in ; as Bodtes sets on the
27th of October. But that the time of night is intended to be referred
to is clear from Statius, Theb. iii. 683 (quoted by Mayor). pigri, in any
’ case, refers to the length of time he takes to disappear beneath the
horizon, owing to the fact that he sets longitudinally.

24-106. ‘Andwhat a meal it is when you have iti and to what degra-
dation does it not expose you l’ Lines 24-79 refer more especially to
the ‘gustatio' or first part of the meal.

24. vinum quod sucida. A passage in Varro, De Re Rustica ii. 11.
272, is referred to as explaining ‘lana sucida? He explains that sheep
begin to sweat in the spring season, whence ‘Sudore recens lana tonsa
sucida appellata est; tonsas recentes eodem die perungunt vino et oleo?
From this passage and from Plin. xxix.9 it would appear that bad wine
was mixed with oil as a fomentation for the sheep after shearing‚ and
applied on wool. Even the '‘sucida lana’ would object to heve to
absorb such stuff.

25. de conviva. ‘From a guest you will see him pass into a mad-
‹lened fanatic’ For this use of ‘de' cf. vii. 197.

26. iurgia3 ‘bickerings’ instead of the ‘promulsis’ are the preinde,
form the only entrleu and give the keynote of what is to follow. Cf.
Verg. Georg. iii. 234 ‘ad pugnam proludit :’ also Cicero Divin. in Caec.
ς 47, where prolusio is opposed to pugna (H.N.).

28. The ‘libertini' or regular retainers‚ would look with jealousy on
the interloping parasitos, and the jealousy shows itself in actual blows
in which thexcups are used as weapons. Cf. Hor. Od. i. 17.r ‘Natis in
usum laetitiae scyphis Pugnare Thracum est?

²9· saguntina. The Saguntiae ware was famous. Pliny’s testimony
to it (xxxv. 12. 46) need mean no more than that it was solid and
durable: lt seems unlikely that vile wine would have been put in costly
jars and given to these parasites.

30. ipae, ‘the master‚' αὐτόςε cf. Catullus iii. 7 ‘suamque norat
Ipsam tam bene quam puella matrem.'

capillato. Cf. iv. 105.
diffimdere is the technical term for ‘bottling off‘ from the ‘dolia’
into the ‘ amphorae‚’ or ‘cadis which were then corked and pitched.

32. cardiaco, ⁴ who needs a cordiul ;' καρδία is used in Greek for 'the
stomach ι’ cs. Thuc. ii. 49 καί ίίποτε εἷς τὴν καρδίαν στηρίξαι.
