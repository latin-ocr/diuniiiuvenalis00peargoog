SATIRE I.

stork, greets them back. A stork‘s nest built on a house is at the
present day in Germany regarded as a sign oi luck ior the house. The
idea seems to be: ‘The most faithful attendants on the temple oi Con·
cordia are-not worshippers, but storks, and Concordia acknowledges
their greeting by clattering back.' The language of Ovid, Met. vi. 97, ’
seems to have been in the poet's mind, ‘Ipsa sibi plaudat crepitante
ciconia rostro! .

117. If a consul will let himself down to calculating how much a
year he makes by the dole, we cannot be surprised at the clients con-
descending to petty tricks to secure the dole on which they and their
families depend ior sustenancel for the fact see Mart. xii. 26, also xi.18,
and x. 10 (quoted by Lewis).

118. rationibus, ‘his income ;’ strictly speaking, ‘his accounts?

119. comites. the poorer clients, the retinue of the wealthy man.

120. densissima lectica, ‘litters in throngs :¹ a collectiveuse of the
singular, as in ‘plurima mortis imago,' and ‘frequens redemptor‚' Hor.

124. It would be natural sor the palanquin to be closely curtained if
it conveyed ladies. ,

126. profer, Galla, caput. Probably Galla's husband speaks all that
is spoken. He says to the slave who is dispensing the dole, pointing to
the closed palanquin, ‘'Tis my wile: send us off: What? you would
not keep usl' Then as the slave, knowing the trick, hesitales, the
beggar adds, ‘Galla put out your headl Oh, don't disturb her, she
must be napping l’

127. The course of the whole day is unnatural and degrading alike
to patroq and client. For the course oi eventp in a Roman day see '
Mart. iv. 8. 1 sqq.

128. Pliny, N. H. vii. 53 (5 183), tells us about‘Apollo eboreusqui est
in soro Augusti:' this must be the statue spoken of here: the lorum
Augusti lay to the Ν.Ε. oi the forum Romanum, it was connected with
atemple erected to Mars Ultor, which was dedicated me. a. On the
question os the topography ol the sorum Augusti see Bam, Rome and
the Campagna p. 92 ‘'l'he only space lest in the eighth region within
which the forum oi Augustus can be supposed to have been contained,

, is that bounded by the Via della Croce Bianca, the Via del Priovato,

and the Via di Tor di Conti.‘ Apollo is spoken of as becoming per·
force an astute lawyer from bearing so many law-suita.

129. triumphales, at the rostra, near which great men had their
statues erected. Suet. Aug. 31 ‘statuas omnium triumphali effigie in
utraque fori sui porticu dedicavit!

130. Arabarches3 properly a customs’ collector in Egypt. Juvenal
employs it merely in a contemptuous sense, as we might use the word
‘ Nabob’ for a rich parvenu oi Eastem extraction. The word Alabarches
is said to be derived from ἀλάβα, ‘ink,’ and to signisy ‘scripturae mag-
ister 3' it appears as a variantfor Arabarches. ln Cicero, Epad Att. ii. 18,
Cicero calls Pompeius ‘Alabarches’ in allusion to his repeated boasts
that he had raised the revenues of Rome; see Billerbeck vol. i. ep. 44
