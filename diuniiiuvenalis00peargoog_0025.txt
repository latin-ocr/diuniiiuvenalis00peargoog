who suffered from chest complaints went to Egypt for the
sake oi the climate, it will appear >possible that Juvenal also
went there of his own accord, and that the visit to a sani-
tarium was confounded by tradition with his disgrace under
Domitian.

In a tabular form Juvenal’s life may be thus arranged con·
jecturally:— ’

Decimus Junius Juvenalis born A. D. 48 at Aquinum.

Between the age of 20 and 30 studies declamation; Vespasian
being Emperor 70-79.

Between 30 and 35 is duumvir quinquennalis and flamen
‚Vespasiani under Titus and Domitian.

Between 3 5 a‘nd 43 is sent on military service to Britain, where
he perhaps serves under Agricola, who was recalled in Α. Ι). 86.

Aet. 44, satirises Crispinus in Satire iv.

Aet. 45, is alluded to by Martial as ‘facundus’ and in lines
which imply that they were intimate and that a slanderer had

Aet. 48-50, publishes Satires iii and iv, under Nerva, A. D.
96-98·

Aet. 53, publishes Satires i and viii, in the early part of
Trajan’s reign, about 101.

Aet 5 5, is alluded to by Martial as paying visits to great men's
’ houses, apparently as a courtier ¹. ·

Aet. 70-72 or 78-80, writes Satires xi, xiii, and xv, under
Hadrian. In xi speaks of himself as an old man living in the
country: in xiii fixes the date at near 119 or 1273 in xv is
evidently iu Egypt, to which by tradition he has been banished.

Juvenal's special place in literature is due very much to the
lact that he belongs to the limited class os satirists proper. We
are not diverted from the consideration of his artistic workman·
ship by needing to follow a narrative. N either is his satire the
mere relies to an argument or a declamation as is habitually the
case with Cicero or Burke. Every line of the Roman poet is
instinct with moral purpose, and beauty of form though aimed
at and attained in a singular degree is throughout secondary
to this. Dean Milman has spoken ol Horace’s Satires as ‘the
