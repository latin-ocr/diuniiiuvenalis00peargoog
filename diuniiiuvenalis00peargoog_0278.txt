SA'HRE XIV.
ΟΝ THE INFLUENCE OF EXAMPLE.

ΤΗΕ allusions in this Satire supply no real evidence of its date, since
at most they prove only that it was composed after a campaign against
the Brigantes (l. 196), and before the construction of Hadrian's palace,
at Tibur, as otherwise the buildings of Cretonius would not be spoken
of (l. 86) as the grandest in that part. There were campaigns against the
Brigantes under Vespasiam under Domitian, and under Hadriam so that
' this teaches us nothing; and Hadrian's palace at Tibur was probably
erected in the latter part of his reign, when Juvenal was dead. Still it is
not impossible that the revolt among the northern tribes which forced
Hadrian to visit Britain in 119, recalled the Brigantes, among whom
Juvenal had once lived, and his own ill-requited services to his recol·
lection. In that case this Satire belongs to his old age, as would seem
probable from its great maturity of thought and elevated morality. In
the ninth Satire Juvenal advocated an honourable life as a ease-guard
against the gossip of slaves. Here it is the infant child who is to stand
between the father and sin, and the vice chiefly reprobated is not that
by which families are ruined, but that by which unrighteous fortunes
are made.

There is a carious illustration of the phrase ‘pueri reverentia'in Pliny's
Epistles, viii. ²4- Pliny tells us that whenever Numidia Quadratilla
played dice, or looked on at the latter, she used to tell her grandson to
go away to his worlr, ‘quod mihi non amore eins magis facere qnam
reverentia videbatur.'
