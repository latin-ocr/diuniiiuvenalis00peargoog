SATIRE XIV.

87. Cretonius chose the most beautiful sites sor building: Caieta was
on the pretty Latian coast, Tibur and Praeneste were in the highlands ol
Latium. The temple ol Fortuna was at Praeneste and that of Hercules
at Tibur. Cretonius eclipsed the finest buildings in the provinces as
effectually as did Posidea, Claudius* favourite‚ the Capitol at Rome.
Pliny, H. N. xxxi. 5. tells us about the ‘Posidianae aquae,' baths which
Posides built at Baiae ; possibly he also built a large house at Rome. Cl.
Suet. Claud. 28. .

manners and cult os this strange sect: the sons actually become Jews.
For the position ol the Jews in Rome see Milman's History οἱ the

metuentem sabbeta. The father followed the prevailing t'ashion
os imitating Eastern religions: cf. Boissier, La Religion romaine vol. ii.
c. ii. The obsenance of the Sabbath was one ol the features in the
Jewish religion which most struck the Romans. Cf. Hor. Sat. i. 9.
69-71 ‘hodie tricesima sabbata? Cf. also Ovid, Rem. Amor. 219 and
Persius v. 184.

from ‘ediscunt‘ and ‘servant ;‘ for the fact alleged see Tacitus, Hist. v.
