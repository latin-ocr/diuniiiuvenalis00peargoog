SATIRE III. NOTES, ll. 270-322.

deiecerintst ‘Si eo ictu homo liber periisse dicetur, quinquaginta
aureorum iudicium dabo,' etc, Ulpiau, ib. 1 pr.

²7²· ignarus. Too ‘lazy’ to attend to the common duties of a citizen.

274. adeo, ‘to such a degree,' ‘so' true is it, that there are as many
chauces of death as there are windows with watchers behind them
(vigiles).

277. patulae pelves, ‘shallow ewers’or ‘footpans'=the Greekrehhr's.

278. Tacitus, Annals xiii. 25, gives a livelypicture of the ‘foeda domi
lieentia: Nero playing the part 'of a common ‘grassator’ The passage
should be read with this.

279. noctem. The ‘grassator' who has not killed somebody in a
street-brawl can’t sleep for remorse: he is as vexed as Achilles was by
the death ol Patroclus, Il. xxiv. ιο, rr.

281. This line is omitted by Weidner and Heineke as destroying the
sequence of the thought. But we can well imagine that a question of
the kind inserted in an exciting description like that which precedes it
would have a telling effect on an audiente. And we should always
think of Juvenal as a reciter with a view to effect. (See Introduction.)

282. ‘However much he have of the impudence of youth, still he
has wits enough to know that he had better keep the rich man-who has
a crowd of retainers-at a respectful distance.' “

²83· The laena was a thick warm cloak worn over the other gar·
ments, especially by the rich, who affected bright colours. See Martial
ii. 57, 3, Persius i. 3²· '

286. deducere, the regular word for ‘ escorting’ on the part of clients
who wished to honour their patrous: ‘ Cum magna multitudo optimorum
virorum me de foro deduceret’ Cic. Fam. x. 12. a. ‘The moon is my
regular and only escort?

287. candelae, a piece of rope dipped in pitch or tallow which
would soon burn out (breve), ⁴ and which I must therefore husband and
cherish’ brevis, short-lived, like ‘brevis rosa' in Horace, Od. ii. 3. 4.

²9²· ouius aceto. The dishes here mentioued were those of the
lowest class at Rome. The wine was sour: the oouohisacommonbeau
eaten by the poor; Mart. v. 39. 10. sectile or sectivum porrum is
the blades of leek cut and eaten as we eat-chives or asparagus. The
grassator then asks‚ ‘What low company have you been keepingl’ '

296. Quaero. In asking a question the present indic. is used when
there is no doubt in the mind of the interrogator as to what the answer
will be: ‘ Surely it is in a prayer-shop that I am to look for youl' cf.
iv. 130 ‘Quidnam igitur censes? Conciditur l' ‘Cut it up, no doubtl’

The proaeuehah are the oratories of the Jews, who were much de·
spised at Rome.

298. ‘They assault you and then bring an action as if you were the
aggressor?

302. Besides these fashionable roysterers common thieves and street
robbers have to be feared.

305. agit rem, ‘does your business?
