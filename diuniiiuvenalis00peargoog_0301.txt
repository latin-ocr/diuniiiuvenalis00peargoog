SATIRE XVI.

fortunate. But we may assume Juvenal to have continued in somemd
train of thought as this-if the man who has made a razzia amougthe
Moors, or demolished the forts of the Brigantes, expects the command
due to his merit. he will find that prefects and tribunes arc madeby
court favour, and are nominated for merits quite unconnected with ser·
vice iu arms. It seems a not impossible suppositiou that this conclusion

has been suppresserl as dangerous. Prof. Nettleship thinks thartha
attacks on military life which characterize Persius and Juvenal, maybe
an echo from the stage, of which the ‘miles gloriosus’ had long baara
familiar property.

Who can enumerate the rewards of a fortunate soldier, for all depends
on fortune, which is even more efficacious than patronagei ll. 1-6.

The soldier’s first reward is that he may pummel his enemy without
fear of being brought to justice for it, ll. 7⁴²· The old law thata
soldier must not run away from the camp to plead in the courts, means
that any man prosecuting a case before a military tribunal has to run
the gauntlet through files of soldiers sympathising with their comrade
and wearing hob-nailed bootS, ll. r 3-a 5. No friend will attend to give
evidence for you in such a case. It is easier to find false witnesses fora
eivilcourt, than men who will testify to thetmth against a soldier, ll. 25-34

Then again, if I have sustained a civil wrong, I have to abide the
interminable delays of the law, 11. 35—473 but soldiers, in consideration
of their calling, are allowed a prompt hearing, ll. 48—50. Soldiers, too,

' are the only men who can dispose of their property by will duringa

father’s lifetime, ll. 51-54. Accordingly, the soldier who has made
prize-money may count his father among his parasites, ll. 54.56; then
again, his promotionis fair, foris it not the general's interest that the
bravest man shall be advancedl ll. 56-60.

legion Iwere joining was a lucky one I should be tempted myself to
enlist.‘ Weidner, following Ο. Jahn, assumes that a verse has fallen ont
after verse 2, for Juvenal is assuming that the army as a professionis
happy and prosperous, and why then should he separate one branch of
it (castra) from the rest, and select it as of specially fortunate chaneest
bnt as the thought seems to be ‘ Luclr has more to do with prosperity
than even a special message to the god of war from his mistress or his
mother,’ it does not seem necessary to assume any lacuna. He seems
to regard the ‘felix ’ as exceptionally blest. Cf. Sat. vii. 190.
