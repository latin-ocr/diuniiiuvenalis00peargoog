SATIRE J.

61, Flaminiam. ΤΙιε great northern road to Ariminum.

Automedon. He in fact imitates a regular chariotee13 as we
might say ‘a ηψπ] Automedon was proverbial from such
passages as Verg. Aen. ii. 477 ‘Equorum agitator Achillis armiger Auto-
medon! nam gives the reason for Juvenal's styling him a regular
charioteer or professional ; he was not ashamed to drive himself. Juvenal
was no admirer of those ‘who witch the world with noble horseman-
ship,' and held driving oneself to be inconsistent with the traditional
Roman ‘gravitas’

62. lacernatae. His lady friend had donned a man's ‘lacema'

64. He has now a ‘lectica hexaphoros ;' in a short time he will have
an ‘octaphorosz’ see Martial vi. 84. Catullus was able to save
enough in Bithynia, he tells us (x. ao), ‘octo homines parare rectos Ad
lecticam!

65. hine atque inde: for the more classical ‘hinc atque hinc!

The cathedra was a woman's lounge, Mart. iii. 6 3, and the occu-
pant was not ashamed to be seen in it: nay, he actually drew back
the curtains that he might be seen.

66. ‘He puts you much in mind of Maecenas that prince of loungers!
Cf. Sat. xii. 39 and Sen. Ep. 114.

67. signator, falso. A forger, who by knavery, via. a short will
and a wet scal, has made himself luxurious and wealthy. Exigua
tabulis and gemma uda are an expansion of ‘falso' Others, like
W, take ‘signator falso’ together ; he explains ‘falso ' as a dative, ‘the
signatary to a forged document? Others take ‘falso’ as an adverb:
but the instances of an adverb following a substantive are rare, though
see Nagelsbach, L. Stil. 5 75. Some editors have adopted Markland's
conjecture ‘signator falsi)

, 68. The will was short; the whole property was transferred to him ;

the wetting of the gemma or seal seems to refer to some facility for
opening the will to see if the provisions were satisfactory: at least
the lines of ovid, Am. ii. 15, seem to speak of a ‘gemma sicca' as
‘tenax'

We have adopted feccrit, with Ribbeck and Beer. 1t has good MS.
authority, and is certainly more elegant, more natural, and more in
Juvenal's style than 'fecerat' Beer points out that the scribe who

wrote the Pithoean Codex is not urtfrequently guilty of writing a vowel

wrogg from his eye catching the same vowel in a preceding or following
wor .

69. occurrit, ‘there meets you'
70. ,viro sitiente 5 abl. abs. There seems no reason to suppose with

W. that viru is the dative and that eo is to be supplied with sitiente.
rubetam is poison procured from the bramble frog (from ⁸ rubus '),
supposed to be very poisonous. Cf. Pliny, H. N. xxv. 76.
71. An improved Lucusta. Lucusta was a Gallie woman suborned by
Nero to poison Britannicus and by Agrippina to poison Claudius.
Cf. Tac. Ann. xii. 66 and xiii. 15, and especially Suet. Nero 33.
