NOTES, ll. 86-116.

from Iulus. 1t must not be forgotten that the aim of Vergil's Aeneid was
to teach the Romans that destiny had made the Romans the successful

- rivals of the Greeks, and that in the success of the Romans the TroJ'ans

had their revenge.

101. Here Juvenal classes himself at least with the poorer classes
if not with the freedmen of Rome. Cf. Sat. iii. 187 and Mart. xii. 18:
from which passages we gather that Juvenal was a ‘ cliens’ in the later
sense of the word, i. e. a dependent upon great houses. See p. xii and
the note on ‘clientela'

da praetori. So that even men in office did not deem it beneath
them to receive the dole. Cf. Mart. ii. 18.

104. The best Romans held all Orientale in contempt. Weidner quotes
Cic. Prov. Cous. 10 ‘ Iudaeis et Syris, nationibus natis servituti? Th'e
· earrings, much worn by Orientals even at the present day, were a sign

of effeminacy (molles).
105. Heinrich, followed by Weidner, thinks that by quinque tabernae
are meant not frve retail shops which he rents, but the five ‘tabemae'
*or places of exchange mentioned by Livy xxvi. 27. a ‘Eodem tempore
(210 lae.) septem tabernae, quae postea quinque, et argentariae, quae
nunc novae appellantur, arsere ;' xxvii. 11. 16 ‘locaverunt inde refici-
enda quae circa forum incendio consumpta sunt, septem tabernas, rna·
cellum, atrium regium‘ In any case the freedman means ‘but my
banking transactions bring me in the magic 4oo,ooo sesterces,' the
knight’s income.
106. purpura maior, i. e. the laticlave or insignia of the senators ς
· ffle meaning is ‘ 1 would rather have the income than the trap ings?

, 107. Laurentum. tle modern Torre di Paterno, described iiy Pliny,
ii. 17. 13. as a good fattening ground for sheep in winter.

108. For the decadence of the corvini, who claimed deseent from
the illustrious ‘gens Valeria: see Tac. xiii. 34.

conductas custodit oves, ‘shepherds sheep for hire?

109. Pallas. Claudius’ notorious freedman, whose wealth is spoken
of by Pliny, N. H. xxxiii. 5 134. He was a brother of the Felix men·
tioned in the Acts of the Apostles.

Licinus, a Gaul, a wealthy freedman of Augustus ς the Licini are
spoken of as types of a class. ’

110. honori, ‘magistrate' ‘holder osan office-⁹

111. Slaves sor sale were exposed on a ‘catasta' and their feet
marked with chalk. Some have sought the origin of this custom in an
attempt to render it easier for them to be tracked in the event of their
running away. Cf. Plin. N. H. xxxv. 17. 58 (ξ 199) arrd Tibull. ii. 2. 59.

113. This line seems a reminiscence of Horace, Ep. i. 6. 36.

115. On ὼε Roman worship of abstract divinities see Marq. iv. aa
aad Boissier, La Religion romaine i. p. 10.

116. This must refer to some circumstance that we are not aware of:
a stork must have built its nest on the temple of Concord: the wor-
