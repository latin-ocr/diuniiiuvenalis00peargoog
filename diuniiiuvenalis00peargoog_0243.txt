SATIRE X.

79. ‘Now sits at home, and longs fretfully but for two things-breed
and the gamas?

81. circenses, i. e. ludos. Cf. viii. 118. panem refers to the
gratuitous donatione of corn made hythe emperors to the poorer
citizens, which drew to the capital the loungers of the country, and
made Rome the gathering-plaee of the riff-raff of Italy.

perituros. Another conversation. ‘I hear there are to be many
executionsi ‘No doubt of it, many another statue will go into the
furnace: my friend Brutidius, when 1 met him to-day in the Campus
Martius, was quite pale.’ The contest between Aiax and Ulysses for
the arms of Achilles was a common theme for declamation, cf. vii.
115. Mayor thinks that Seianus is here called Aiax, and that Brutidius
defended him and failed: hence he, ill-defended, avenges himself on his
lukewarm advocate, gloating over his terror from the other world. It
seems simplet to refer Aiax to Tiberius, and to suppose that Juvenal
has transferred the epithet which suited Aiax to Tiberius, whom it did
not precisely fit.

87. ‘But let our slaves see that we insult our Caesar’s enemy, to pre·
vent their turning round and accusing us of lack of loyalty.¹ The
testimony of slaves was accepted in the case of persons accused of high-
treason, and Tiberius employed this as a useful way of arriving at the
secrets of the nobility of his time. Cf. Tac. Ann. ii. 28. 30.

90. salutari. To have as many attendants on your morning
‘salutatio'

91. illi, more commonly huic and illi, though ‘ille’ followed hy ‘ illi’
is not pacommon.

93. augrrsta. Another reading is ‘angusta' ‘Augusta’ will point to
the majesty conferred on the barren rock hythe presence of the Emperor
with his horde. Suetonius tells us that ‘Tiberius was nicknamed Capri·
neus from his love of Capri: no doubt with a further allusion to his
incontinence.

94. oum grege Chaldaeo. Chaldaei was the common name given
to astrologers. Cf. Tac. Anu. ii. ²7·

pila, as ‘primipilus centurio :¹ cohortes as ‘tribunus militum’

95. egregiosequitea. The technical name given to rich youngmen of

promise by Augustus was ‘equites illustres,' or ‘splendidi ;’ these were

. regarded by him as forming a nursery for future statesmen. cf, Tac. Anu.

xi. 4. It is probably to these that Juvenal here refers.
castra domestica· The praetorians, collected hy Seianus into a
standing camp. The meaning is, ‘ Yon would like to have army ap·

pointments at your disposal‚ and body guards as well)
97. ‘What lot so brilliant or prosperous is worth having on condition

(ut = ἐφ’ pire) that the corresponding measure of evil shall accompany itf'
99. ‘ Would you rather wear the “ praetexta ” of a Seianus than be the

“pometa'' of some country town like Ulubrae, in his tawdrystatef'

¹Ulubrae is named hy Horace as the type of a small country town, Ep.

1. 11. 3o; and Gabii ib. 7. ’
