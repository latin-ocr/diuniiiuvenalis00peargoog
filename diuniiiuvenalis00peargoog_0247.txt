SATIRE X.

172. sarcophagus. Pliny, N. H. ii. 98, tells us that this name was
originally applied to a particular kind of limestone quarried at Assos in
the Troad, remarkable for its peculiar power οἱ consuming the ilesh and
bones: ‘Circa Asson Troadis lapis nascitur quo consumuntur omnia
corpora: sarcophagus vocatur) Hence it was applied generally to a
coffin.

fatetur, ‘brings out.'

173. quantula. Diminutives are a marked characteristic of the Silver
age; they were likewise common in Plautus, and doubtlessin the spoken
Latin, and many modern F rench substantives are formed from them, as
‘abeille’ from ‘apicula’

174. The story ia told in Herodotus vii. 21 sqq. ‘how Xerxes cut a
canal through the isthmus connecting the peninsula· with Chalcidice.’
The trace of this canal is still most distinctly to be seen: see Lieut.
Wolse's remarks quoted in the article on Athos in the Dictionary os
Greek and Roman Geography.

175. constratum classibus isdem. Herodotus nii. 33, 36.

177. The words of Herodotus arc κοῖον δὲ πινόμενόν μιν ὕδωρ οὐκ
ἐπέλιπε, πλὴν τῶν μεγάλων ποταμῶν. The prandium is the late break-
fast between the ientaculum and the coena. Thus the sense is, ‘they
say that the rivers were drunk up by the Mede even for his breakfast?

178. Sostratus (an unknown poet) recited with such excitement that
he perspired. Such a proceeding in the ancients excited rather ridicule
than disgust. Horace had made enemies by coupling Gorgonius with
‘hircus’ The language seems suggested by Ovid, Met. i. 264 ⁴ madidis
notus evolat atis? .

183. The story is from Hdt. rii. 35. It was a common theme for ι
declamation, and Juvenal’s avowed disbelief of the Greek legends would
not be inconsistent with a belies that Xerxes was capable of such a mad
freak. -

branded the sea.

187. totiens with ‘optata’

188—237. Length of days, the universal prayer, is but increasing
misery. Think of its ailments, its bereavements, of the anguish os its
solitudel , Cf. the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite (old age), οὐλόμενον,
καματηρόν, ὅ,τε στυγέουσι θεοί περ.

189. alto vultu, the reading ot P, seems to mean with ‘counte-
nance bold and confident3' as in Hor. Od. iv. 9. 42 ‘Reiecit alto dona
nocentium Vultu ;’ pallidus, ¹ wan' with anxiety. ‘ Men pray t'or old age
whether in good fortune or in bad.’

190. Cs. Hamlet's remarks to Pplonius, Act i. Sc. a. Cf. also Lucret.
lib. iii. 452 quoted by Montaigne in his Essay on Old Age, which has
many thoughts in common with this passage.
