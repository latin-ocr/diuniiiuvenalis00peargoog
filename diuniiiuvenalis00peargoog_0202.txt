’ sarran V. Norba, 11. 2·3·

Satire affords us a good picture of the life of the millionaires at Rome,
with their outward affectation of pristine Roman simplicity and ‘gravi-
tas‚' and their private life of luxury and sels-indulgence. For the sensu·
ality described see Lecky’s History of European Morals vol. i. ch. ii.

You must be the vilest of men if you can bear the life of a parasite, while
there is a beggar's stand unoccupied on which you may squat and eat dog-
cake,ll.1-11. An invitation once in two months is considered ample return
for all your arduous dancing of attendance, 11, 12-23. Whata feast! You
get sour and heady wine out ofa cobbler's pot; he drinks the generous
juice of the grape mellowed by centuries out of goblets plated with
· amber and studded with gems, ll. ²4-49. For him the iced water served
by the graccful Asiatic b0y; for you the tepid draught hauded carelessly
by the sinister-looking and gaunt negro, ll. 50066. Your host has the
soft rolls of white bread3 and yon get the hard crusts that shine with
age. Was it for that you trudged through hail and fog, leaving your

wife's side? ll. 67-79. Note the difference of the fine crayssfish put before
the lord; the paltry crab served to yoursels; contrast his sance of

clear olive-oil with yours of stinking lamp-oil‚-the mullet or lamprey
the great man brings from Corsican or Sicilian waters with your eel or
pike that has fattened in the Roman drains, ll. 80-106. And let the
rich man observe that no one wants him to- be generous; we only
wish him to observe the court'esy of equal fellowship at his meals,
11. roy-113.

Look again at the capon, the boar, the truffles; hear the patron's
vaunt of wealth 3 watch the graces of the professional carver3 and
observe the strict etiquette that is enforced‚ 11. 113-127. No poor man
can talk with his host ou equal terms, 127-131. But become rich, and
γοα are Virro’s friend ; be childless, and he in turn will be your flatterer;
yet even if you have a large family, your wealth will purchase you
consideration, ll. 132-145. Even to mushrooms and dessert will the
distinction of ranks be preserved at that table, 146-155. Do you think
all this is Virro's economyl First, he does it to enjoy the comedy of
a disappointed parasite, and to watch your looks as you calculate
whether a costly dish will hold out till it reaches you. He appraises
you at your true value, a possible buffoon, ll. 156-173.

2. quadra, ‘ table,’ as in Vergil, Aen. vii. 114.

3. sarmentus. Plutarch (Ant. 59) tells us of a Sarmentus, afavourite
of Augustus. Sarmentus was also the name of the opponent of Cicirrus
in Horace, referred to on p. 126. The Scholiast, quoted by Heinrich, tells
us of a Sarmentus who, by his wit, attained a fortune and the office of
‘decuria quaestoria) Elated by this, he appeared in the theatre as a
Roman knight‚ on which the populace composed on him the following
pasquinade:-
