two exquisite lines, wishing the vise ancestors who introduced
the practice a light grave and fragrant dafiodils and deathless
spring in their ums. It is followed up by a playsul image of
Achilles shrinking from the rod under the care of a long-tailed
centaur. The vanity of life is a common-place of the moralist,
but was it ever condensed with such incisive strength as in me
