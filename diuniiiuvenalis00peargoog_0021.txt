ordered on a'ctive service, as Russian liberals are sent to the
Caucasus. There are reasons to be considered later on which
will make it appear probable that this period of disgrace was
under Domitian.

This explanation has not taken into account the common
story related in Life lv, as given by Jahn, that Juvenal was
sent into exile for the lines relating to Paris, the actor, that
· is, that he was exiled by Domitian in sorne year before 83 A.1).,
when Paris died. There are insuperable difficulties about
that story in its common form. One is, that the seventh
ἱ Satire opens with a high compliment to the Emperor, whom the
attack on his favourite a little further on is supposed to have
alienated. The other is that the legendary account represents
Juvenal as dying of grief in his banishment‚ whereas he certainly
survived Domitian by more than thirty years. Mr. Lewis dis-
poses very happily of these difficulties by assuming that the
‘histrio’ mentioned in l. 90 is different from ‘ Paris,’ and that
the Satire really belongs to the time of Hadrian, ‘who banished
and afterwards put to death Apollodorus the celebrated architect,
owing to a sarcastic expression of the latter.' It may be added
that Juvenal’s complaints would excite much more indignation
’ if he was in the army. One of the' lives which seems to refer
the composition of the Satire to the time of Trajan, repurts
Trajan as having· commented upon it with the remark, ‘Why
you yourself got your promotion through Philomela? This
would appear to show that Juvenal owed his own appointment
in the first instance to his literary work. The last epigram
Martial addressed to him, which was written about A.D. 104,
shows that he was then in Rome making a round of visits to his
patrons. This is not necessarily inconsistent with the fact that
his cohort was stationed in Britain. He may have applied for
. furiough to visit his friends and have tried while he was at
home to get moved into Italy or to get increase of rank.
Neither, however, is it impossible that by this time Juvenal had
completed his term of service.

There remains the story that he ended his days in Egypt.
That he visited that country at some time seems probable from
the lise-like reference to the big breasts of the women of Meroe
(xiii. 16), and almost demonstrated by the fifteenth Satire, which
