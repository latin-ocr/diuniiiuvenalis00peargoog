tables were of native wood, blown down, bnt now the broad panels are
borne np by carved ivory, and silver is of no account, 11. 117-127. Be
warned that at my house you will find only knives with bone-handus
and the slave who carves will not have learned the art on woodeu
models and cannot even steal dexterously, ll. 1²9-144· A country boy,
whom yon will have to address in latin, will serve you with drink.
The boy with his hair cut short and combed straight will be taken from
country life and sighing for his mother and her goats; not a page such
as great men love. The wine he hands you will come from the sapie
hills as himself, ll. 145-161. Expect the dancing girls such as decent
women endure to look at, not such as stimulate lust in their lords,
lt 162-170. lt takes a fortune to excuse these accompaniments,
ll. 171-178. But you shall hear recitations from the Iliad or the
Aeneid, ll. 179—182.

But now put business aside and prepare for a whole day‘s idleness,
without thought ol the money-market or conjugal or household troubles
or ungrateful friends, ll. 183-192. To-day‚ the shout of games will go
up, and 1 seem to hear that green has won; for if this shout were not
borne on the wind, Rome would be'wailing. Leave this to the young
man and his lady-love, ll. 193-202. Be it ours to suu ourselves and to
bathe, enjoying these single pleasures the more because we so seldom
get them ll. 203-208.

who was very rich. Cornelius Nepos, Life of Atticus v. 14, tells us
, that he inherited two large fortunes. Others have thought of Ti. Clau-

discovered a treasure in his house. In any case ‘Atticus' stands for the
typical millionaire. ’
