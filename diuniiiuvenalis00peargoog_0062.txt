as princes, such as Tiberius, Claudius and Nero, fell speedily

into a career of profligacy and debauchery under the corrupting
influences by which they were surrounded.

Clz'entela : Sportula-Roman statesmen had from very early
times kept open house to numerous guests, and aided them with
their services· The ‘cliens 'as such, being a member of no com-
munity, had no rights in Rome. A man who belonged to any
community having no league with Rome, or who was exiled from
his own house to Rome, had no legal position. He had no choice
but either to sell himself as a slave or to place himself under the
protection of a Roman citizen who might maintain his personal
freedom intact, but take him into his own ‘potestas3' hereby
obliging himself to protect his protlglfrom violence,to protect him
in the law-courts, and to see him decentlyburied. As longas the
Patricii were the only full burgesses, of cours'e they were the only s
class who could patronise clients. The relations of clients to their
‘patroni' were of great intimacy. The ‘cliens’ entered into the
‘potestas’ of his ‘patronus’ and therewith into close and intimate
friendship. He ¹took the name of his patron's ‘gens,’ accompanied
him abroad, helped to dower his daughter, and undertook to
ransom him if captured by the enemy. And the duties were
understood to be reciprocal. Neither party could bear witness

v against the other in the law-courts: the patron deemed that
his obligations towards the client exceeded those towards his
blood relations, and any infractiori of the duties on either side
was looked on as a crime to be visited with death. ‘Libertini’
or freedmen are merely a species of clients. Their emancipation,
depended upon the expressed intention of their owner to make
no use of his rights as such. But by forbearing to exercise
these rights, and by declaring his intention to regard the slave
as out of his ‘ potestaS,’ the master calls into being-not a citizen
of Rome-but a creature lordless and homeless and needing
lasting protection. ’ Hence the ‘libertus’ remains in the house
and service of his former master, or is furnished by him with
land or funds; he adopts his late master‘s name, and stands
as much under his jurisdiction after his emancipation as before
u.

The names ‘ clientela’ and ‘clientes’ under the Empire express
a different relationship from that explained as prevailing under
