ivernali. 116-144.

As a matter 01 fact there was one Tiberius Julius Alexander, son of the
Arabarch Alexander Lysimachus, an Egyptian Jew, who abjured his
religion, and became successively a Roman ‘eques,’ procurator of
Judaea, and finally Praefectus Aegyptiae. Titus gave the renegade
a high command against the Jews -

133. After wandering about all day, the poor clients, tired and hungry,
come back and hope to get a meal; buthave to give up praying even

for this; they have to go off and buy with the dole their kail and
fuel.

136. This use 0f rex for a ‘great man' or ‘patron' is common.

111111111111111111.61111. Pisonem 67 ‘Graeci stipati, quini in
lectis, saepe plures, ipse solus) Everything in the house is arranged for
guests‚ but the couches remain empty, and the master sits down alone ς
for the picture 01 a glutton who has lost his appetite cf. Churchill’s
poem ‘The Times' and his picture of Apicius.

137, 138. These lines are rejected by Ribbeck; but the meaning
seems plain. The orbes are the round tables of the expensive citrus
(cp. Hehn p. 361), supported by a single foot, itself often of ivory.
The ‘orbes’ were often masterpieces of antique art, and thus their
antiquity gave them additional value. Juvenal complains that though
10 many costly tables are in the rich man's palace, pointing 10 the duties
01 hospitality, yet he devours whole patrimonies at a single one.

139. ‘The race of parasites will soon be extinct,' so Juvenal makes
the rich man say; much as we might make a rich man console himself

the multiplicatiori of beggars.

140. luxuriae sordes. An oxymoron. ‘Such meanness in luxury)

141. Cf. Varro, R. R. ii. 4. 10 ‘Suillum pecus donatum a natura

dish for a party.

141. But the punishment follows close 01 the offence: both the fact
01 eating alone and 01 eating too much gives you indigestion.

143. crudum, ‘undigested.' Weidner, following the Ρ1111., reads
‘crudus' i. e. you suffering from indigestion. Lewis calls attention to
Martial's pun on this double 11111 01 the word, iii. 13 ‘Accusas
rumpisque coquum tanquam omnia cruda Attulerit: nunquam sic ego
crudus ero ;' i. e. I shall never become a dyspeptic thus.

pavonem. Varro, De Re Rust. iii. 6. 6, tell us that the orator
Hortensius was the first who served up roasted peacocks, and this was
on the occasion of his election as augur. Cicero remarks on his own
audacity in giving Hirtius a dinrer without peacock (Ad Fam. ix.
20. 3); cf. also Plin. Nat. Hist. x. 23, 24·

144. ie. hence so many old men leave no wills: they die so suddenly
that they have no time to make them. Men put off making their will'
