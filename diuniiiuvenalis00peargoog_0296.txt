42· Like the Roman ‘lectisternia’ but of longer duration.

43. pervigili toro. The cushion plied or pressed all night long.

45. quantum ipse· notavi. Juvenal then had certainly been in
Egypt, and itis possible that the notice iu the Pseudo-Suetonius is·
based upon this passage, which alleges that Juvenal was ‘per honorem ’
militiae, quamquam octogenarius urbe summotus missusque ad praefectu-
ram cohortis iu extrema parte tendentis Aegypti’ (quoted by Mayor).
See Introduction p. vii.

46. We need not conclude from this passage, with Ribbeck, that
Juvenal did not know that Canopus was in Egypt3 he merely contraste-
‘Aegyptus barbara ’-un·Greek Egypt—with licentious Canopus, which
was an international home ior great luxury. famosus is ‘notorious’
‘Luxuria' is used in a slightly wider sense than usual to cover the
refinemeut of cruelty evinced by cannibalism in the one case, and that
evinced by Canopic profligacy on the other.

47. adde. For the connection we must go back to v. 40 sqq.

madore is the regular word ‘for to be drunk.’ Cf. ‘plane mattus

Cf. Strabo xvii. 1.14,Di0dor.i. 34, Colum. x. 114. ,

49. nigro. They had a negro piper and such ungnents as they could

57. alias, disfigured, so as not to be known for their own.

61. quo with accusative is characteristically Juvenalian. Cf viii. 90.

64. The regular missiles in a riot at home as contrasted with a foreign
war. Cf. Verg. Aen. i. 150. ‘Domesticum belium’ is a regular ex-
pression for ‘a riot.'

65. Turnus, Verg. xii. 896. Aias, Hom. ll. vii. 268. Tydeus, Hom.
ll. v. 302.

Greek, and comes in for some of the incredulity bestowed on ‘Graecia
mendax!

71. ridet, ‘at their size ;' odit, ‘their malice!

72. Let us resume the story from its digression. '

73. aueti and pars altera both refer to the Ombitae. The form
Ombi for Ombitae seems used ou the analogy of Memphi, Bactri, etc.

76. praestare terga is used in a like way in Tac. Agr. xxxvii.

palmae. ‘To the south of Thebes is the open plain broken only
by palm groves' (Sharpe chap. ii). The lines are mock heroic: and the ·
contrast between the calm retreat of the umbrageous palme and the
miserable fugitives is intentional. ’

82. usque adeo would in classical Latin be ‘ adeo’ merely.

senseo ‘ re.'
