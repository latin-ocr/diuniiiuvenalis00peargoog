38 INTRODUCTION. 0

at their cowardice we recoil from their baseness or shudder at
their wickedness. The mellow Crispus, who did not stake his
life upon honest speech, Crispinus reeking of balsam almost as
foully as two corpses, and Pompey who could slit throats by a
piping whisper‚ are all such figures as Michael Angelo might
have designed for a group in hell.

It remains only to notice Juvenal’s influence upon modern
literature. The poet in whom he most completely lives again is
Dryden, who translated five of the Satires (i, iii, vi, x and xvi).
Dryden has the same vigour of expression, and a similar earnest·
ness of tone, but seems to want the light touches which relieve
Juvenal's shadows. Whenever we take a parallel passage we
shall be conscious that the Roman poet with all his austerity is
the truer artist. Dryden tells us of the Egyptian gods,

‘Such savoury deities must needs be good
As served at onoe sor worship and for sood!

Juvenal remarks with quiet scorn,

‘O sanctas gentes quibus haec nascuntur in hortis
Numina!

Compare again the coarse positivism ol the lescription of

‘Bulliaced Jonas who could statutes draw
To mean rebellion, and make treasou law’
with the incomparable picture of

‘Saevior illo
Pompeius tenui iugulos operire susurro? ·

On the other hand Juvenal has shown no capacity for limning
such exquisite portraits of character as Dryden has left us
in the descriptions of Achitophel and Zimri. In matters of that ’
sort, Dryden was the dramatic poet, thinking out the man in his
innermost thoughts and extravagant caprices‚ while Juvenal was
nothing more than the moralist declaiming against an incarnate
vice. Just the half-finished sketches of Crispus and Catullus
remain to attest a power upon which its possessor never really
drew; but Crispinus, Oppia, Sejanus, Messalina pass before us
as shadowy and unsubstantial as the personified miseries of
Vergil's hell, ‘Metus et malesuada Fames et turpis Egestas!

While Dryden qua satirist was the Juvenal osan English court,
