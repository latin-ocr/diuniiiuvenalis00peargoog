SATIRE VII.

distributing the goods at auction, and is meant to recal such words as
‘ rectio' and ‘sectou’

ιο. commissa auctio. Variously interpreted. Mayor, following
Grangaeus‚ takes it to be a metaphor from the gladiatorial school.
Two gladiators were ‘commissi‘ ‘matched' against each other. The
expression would thus be equivalent to ‘the battle of the auction room.’
Weidner takes it more simply as ‘the auction goods entrusted by the
people to the praeco for sale,' and this seems the simplest interpre-
tation. lewis takes it to mean ‘the auction of confiscated goods.' ‘fisco
adiudicatomm,' referring to Cic. Verr. ii. 1. ιο, and to the law
writers. But, as we have seen, these auctiou rooms were private. aud
the sale of confiscated goods would bc public.

11. oenophorum, ‘a wine jar) Cf. Hor. Sat. i. 6. ¹⁰9 ‘ pueri lasanum
portantes oenophorumque ς’ and Persius, Sat. v. 140.

armaria, ‘cupboards‚' Fr. ‘ armoires.'

12. Poor productioris of poor poets of the day, who wrote on the
commonplaces of tragedy. For the story os Alcithoe see Ov. Met. v.
1. 4o; for Thebes, Mart. xiv. 1 ; for Tereus, Ov. Met. vi. 424.

13. ‘Even this is better than perjuring yourself for pay aster the
manner of our new aristocracy from Asia? The senate was largely re·
cruited from the provinces by Vespasian, and iu Trajan’s time a Moorish
grandee, Q. Lucius Quietus, was actually raised to the consulship. The
Romans looked upon these new dignitaries in much the same way as an
English Μ.Ρ. would regard au Iudian prince who might be enuobled
and take his seat in the House of Lords.

15. This verse is generally admitted to be spurious, (1) because the
Cappadoces and Bithyni would be included in the Asiani ; (a) because
the first syllable of Bithyni appears to be elsewhere used long⁸¹ Mayor

reads—
‘faciant equites Asiani

Quanquam et Cappadoces: faciant equites Bithyni‚' etc.
which assumes that Juvenal confused Bithynia and Galatia.

16. Those which New Gaul (Galatia) sends over sea in the ‘catasta'
This was a large cage or frame in which slaves were exhibited to show
them off: it seems to have been worked by some machinery: cf. Stat
Silv. ii. 1. 72 ‘Nou te barbaricae versabat turbo catastae? Tibull
iii. 60 calls it ‘barbara' Cf. Sat. i. 111 and Mart. x. 76. In the year
278 certain Gaulish bibes left Brennus and'were iuvited into Asia by
Nikomedes of Bithynia, and settled in Gallo-Graecia by Attalus I.
about ²30 n. c.

18. ‘But now no true poet who weds eloquent words to tuneful num·
bers will be forced to go a begging.‘

19. laurumque momordit, as did the Delphic priestess.

ao. hoc agite, ‘attention l' This was originally a sacrificial phrase
pronounced by the priest before sacrificiug the victim to call the atten-
tion of the spectators; cf. Plut. Num. 14. It then came to be used

generally for ‘give your best attentiou‚‘ ‘persovere' Cf. Cic. Tusci.
