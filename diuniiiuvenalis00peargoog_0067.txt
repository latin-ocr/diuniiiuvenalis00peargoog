Ι 60 INTRODUCTION.

lt appears then that Livius Andronicus out ol the existing
Satura evolved a play. The new element added by him seems
to have been a plot (argumentum). He turned a rough uncul·
tivated medley inio a consistent play. The ‘saturae modis
impletae ’ probably consisted of dialogum, which were always an
ingredient in Roman satire, and indeed have continued at all
times to form an essential characteristic os the literature popular
among the Romans, from the time of Ennius down to that oi
Parini and Belli¹.

The name Satura was next adopted by Ennius and Pacuvius
as a name for their literary miscellanies, inwhich the clement of
dialogue was probably an ingredient. . ’

Lucilius maintained the character of the Satire as a ‘mis-

⁴ cellany,’ both in the diverse form of the subjects with which he

dealt, and in the mixture oi metres which he employed. But he
it was who first employed the word in something resembling the
modern sense. It was Lucilius who first employed satire as the
natural corrector of the vices os the public men who from his ’
time to the end of the Republic were becoming more and more
corrupt ². He boldly follows the Greek writers of the Old
Comedy and pillories vice and incapacity whenever he sees it.
Avarico, sensuality‚ discontent‚ flattery, cringing‚ incapacity, are
depicted by Lucilius as the vices of the Rome ol his day, and
denounced in the most glowing language. But Lucilius in giving
to Satura a more definite meaning, narrowed at the same time

’ its scope and its form. He confined its form mainly to the

Hexameter, and led his successors to regard invective as an
integral part of its contents. Ι1 hasbeen pointed out³ that
Horace in his well-known criticism of Lucilius (Sat. i. 4and i. 10),

Ι objects to Lucilius as ‘hanging entirely to the Old Comedy,’

i.e. as conceiving the scope of his work to consist mainly in
chastising vice generally and specially in prominent politicians.

Marcus Terentius Varro of Reate (1 16-127), amongst numerous
other branches of literature, devoted himself to Satura, and con-
ceived of it as in its primitive sense instead of that given it by
