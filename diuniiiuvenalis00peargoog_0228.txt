NOTES, ll. ’39εὸ 5.

which it appears that one of the objects of his gossip was the
' knowledge of horses’ pedigrees. Martialiii.63. 12 mentions a horse
Hirpinus.
64. ibi, in the circus.
gratia. ‘No thahks are due to ghosts; no one cares for a horse’s
departed ancestors‚ if itself win no prizes’

66. epiredia. Taken by some to mean the packwaggon which fol·
lows the ‘reda ;’ others interpret it as the thong which joins the collar to
the chariot. Quintilian remarks on the word as a hybrid between
Greek and Celtic, i. 5. 68.

67. digni, i. e. ‘they are no better than asses ¹ which were usually
employed to turn mills. Cf. Lukian, Asin. 42.

Nepotis, a miller of the day.

68. privum, ‘'of your own? ‘Privus’ is an archaic word used by
Hor. Sat. ii. 5. 10 ; but to express ‘one's own’ we commonly find in
classical Latin ‘meus,’ ‘tuus' ‘suus’ ‘ipsius‘ or ‘proprius’

71-146. ‘Depend on yourself, and not on your ancestors, Ponticus.
Let duty be your watch word ς die before you lose your seli-respect or
abuse a charge entrusted to your care)

73. sensus communis, ‘the true feeling of equality as between citi·
zen and citizen’ So Weidner rightly explains it. Horace uses the ex-
pression, Sat. i. 3. 66, to signify the delicate intuitive feeling for the
behaviour due from man to man in order to pass through life pleasantly.

75. futurae laudis. ‘While yourself doing no deed bound up with
praise in the future) This is a somewhat curicus use of the genitive of
, quality, which in the Silver Age of Latinity had a wider use than in
classical Latin. ,

76. ‘'Tis a sorry thing to have only the reputation of others to lean
on: the columns may give way and the roos will fall in: the vine, reft
of its supporting tree, falls to earth! The ulmi are said to be viduae,
as torn from or divorced from their natural partners, the vines. ‘

Α 79. arbiter. The ‘arbiter‘ nearly answers to our ‘arbitrator' See
Gaius, iv. 163 (Poste) ‘a defendant may prefer arbitration without mis-
trusting the justice of his cause?

81. Phalaris. The cruelty of this Sicilian tyrant has passed into a
proverb; so that cie. Ad Att. vii. 12 speaks of φαλαρισμός 101 tyranny.
The story was that he engaged one Perillns to fashion for him a brazen
bull, into which he thrust his victims and then applied tire to the bull,
so that it seemed to be bellowing. See Pindar, Pyth. i. 185.

83. pudor, ‘honour ι’ αἰδώς, whence springs σωφροσύνη. Weidner well
quotes Pliny, Ep. v. 1. 6 ‘neque aderat alius qui defunctae pudorem
tueretur.¹

84. vivendi causas, ‘motives for living.¹ Cf. Plin. Ep. i. 12. 3.
Reason drove Corellius to the resolution of ending his life ‘quamquam
plurimas vivendi causas habentem!

85. ‘The wicked man is as good as dead though he have every luxury.¹

perit is the perfect tense, as in Sat. vi. ²95· ’
