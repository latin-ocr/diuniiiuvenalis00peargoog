28 INTRODUCTION.

itself to one who probably knew nothing of Christ’s teaching, it
would be the Jewish saith with its simple doctrine of one God, its
austere law, and its honourable freedom from immoral orgies.
Some, however, of Juvenal’s most scathing lines are directed
against Judaism, and it is curious to notice with what skill he has
J contrived to discover all the weak points in its harness. The belief
in an abstract cloud-like deity without a mediator, the prohibi-
tion to eat pork, circumcision, the fierce intolerance of other
nations’ customs, the prejudice against the rendering of kindly

offices to strangers, are all enumerated as essential parts of the
religion. lt may fairly be assumed that Juvenal was unac-

quaintedwith Philo's defence of his people, and that he is not
to be charged with deliberate unfairness. Even so it is remark-
able that he should recoil so repugnantly from naked theism, and
the fact rn'ay be counted as an additional proof that Juvenal was
sincere in his reverence for the divinities os his own country, and
liked to believe that he lived in aworld where the gods were
near men. His reproach of a bitter caste feeling against the
Jews may seem to corne with an ill grace from one who certainly
would have regarded a marriage between Jew and Roman as
impure, but it marks the change whichworld-wide Empire and
its necessities had introduced since the time when a Roman
citizen could not contract any obligation of the highest religious
validity from marriage (connubium) to sale (sponsio) witha
foreigner. ‘

, ⁶ Juvenal's attitude towards literature is that of a man who
wished to rise by it, and who was bitterly disappointed that
neither eloquence nor poetry had helped him on in the race of
life. The undesigned evidence of the Satires goes to show
that he was rather the practical man, wielding literature as a
weapon with which to hew his way in the world, than the
literary man regarding study and the pursuit of the Muses as
the highest good. When he speaks of how to train a child, he
says that he is to be educated for statesmanship and military Δ
service and the management ol an estate, and he praises the old
austere life on afarm, but he nowhere givesahint that philosophy
or poetry is to be studied. His own boast that he was unlea‘rned
in Greek philosophy, and the fierce diatribe against learned
women, and the scorn of Greek versatility must be taken as
