, leti iuvenem‚' ‘he called the young man happy in respect os his death.’

vacula, ‘ empty‚' and so ‘quiet’ Cf. ‘mihi vacuum Tibur placet' Hor.
Ep. i. 7. 45. The contrast is with the noise of Rome.
cumis. The original Cumaean Sibyl was Deiphobe, daughter of
Glaucus, who lived in a grotto near Cumae. From her Tarquin procured
the three Sibylline bookS, which were preserved in the Capitol till the
time of Sulla, when they perished in a fire.

3. destinet, ‘he intends;’ from the root sta, whence seems to have
been formed a participial stem sta-uo ; and heuoe a verb ‘stanare,' to ‘ fix’
or ⁸ settle ;’ whence ‘destinare’ ‘to propose' or ‘have a fixed intention!
In Russian ‘stany' is used sor ‘I intend,‘ or ‘will;’ cs. also the nse
os ‘ sto' in Italian in ‘sto per fare?

4. lanua, ‘the approach' to Baiae from Rome For this use of

' ianua cf. Cic. Plane. iii. 8 ‘Qua nolui ianua sum Ingressus in caussam?

Domitian carried a branch of the Via Appia to meet at this point the

litus, to be taken closely with ‘amoeni secessus) which is a geni·
tive of quality, specially common in Low Latin, and adopted thence by
classical writers: ‘’Tis a pleasant} shore oi sweet retirement? The gen·
itive os quality or attributive genitive marks the whole or main charac-
teristic of that which it qualifies: the ablative marks merely an
accidental attribute. Thus ‘vir magnae prudentiae' would signisya
man in whose character prudence is the main feature. ‘Vir magna pru·
dentia,’ a man, as we say, of prudence. The genitive os quality is really
adjectival; thus ‘fallax herba veneni' Verg. Ec. iv. ²4 may be ex·
pressed by ‘a poisonous herb) ,

5. Prochytam. Procida, a sterile volcanie island off the Campa·
nian coast. Τὴε Subura lay at the back os the Argiletum, and seems
to have extended across the valley between the Esquiline and the Qui·
rinal. cf. Eum, Rome and the Campagna p. 80. It was the noisiest
and most immoral part oi Rome. Cf. Martial xii. 18. 1, 2

‘Dum tu forsitan inquietus erras
Clamosa, Iuvenalis, in Subura?

6. ‘For any abode, however comfortless or solitary, is better than
this constant fear'of fires.’ Our idiom would be to say ‘that you
would not think it better than the dread os fiae? The Latin idiom is to
say ‘that you would not think the dread os fires worse.'

7. Fires were very common at Rome, owing to the amount οἱ wood
used in the construction of the houses; and these were raised to a great
height, as land was very dear.

9. Augusto. The recitations, trying at any time, were in the hottest
and nnhealthiest month intolerable. For these recitations see Pliny,
Ep. i. 13and Hor. Sat. i. 5. 1.

10. sod dum. ‘But while all his household was being packed away
