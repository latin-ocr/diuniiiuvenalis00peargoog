ΟΝ THE LITERARY CONNECTION OF
MARTIA'L AND JUVENAL.

Paornssoa Namnasnm has tarny, in a public lecture
delivered at Oxford‚ called attention to the remarkable corre-
spondence between the epigrams of Martial and the satires ol
Juvenal. He has kindly allowed me in this note to make use
of the conclusions at which he has arrived. The correspondence
referred to is apparent, not merely in the view of literature held
by the two poets, but in the subjects they treat, the persons
they mention, the diction they employ, and their general colour3
and he thinks it probable that Juvenal and Martial were much
in each other’s confidence, and actually worked and it may
almost be said, thought, in common. According to this view
Juvenal will have been much the younger manos the two,
probably by some ten or twenty years. Martial died, as we
know, at about the age of sixty, in the year 101 or 102 n. D.
lf wc compare Martial, Book VII. 24, with ib. 91, in which
Juvenal is addressed as ‘facundus’ (applied to eloquent writers
as well as eloquent speakers), and if we accept the view adopted
by Friedlander, that the date ol Martial's seventh book is
92 Α. 1), we are led to suppose that Martial may have known
of Juvenal as a writer as early as 92 Α. Ι). They will thus have
had ten years ol intimacy, an intimacy which may be compared
to that between Calvus and Catullus or that between Vergil and
Horace.

This correspondence manifests itself-

(1) In the view of literature adopted by both poets alike.
Cf. Martial, IV. 49 and X. 4 with Juvenal, 1. 52, 85.

(2) ln the similarity of subjects treated.
