NOTES, l. 1.

isolate the noble by driving his family retainers away, 11.·109-125.
Ay, and let the poor man ask himself if heis of any real account to
the noblewho cares only for inheritances and whose pleasnres are all
costly, ll. 126-136. Nothing but wealth is now valued in Rome.
The poor man is laughed at and thrust up into the worst seats in the
amphitheatre. lt is the rich man, who can marry wealth, and to whom
money is left, who can sit in the municipal council. Nowhere'is money
more necessary for getting on thau in Rome, 11. 1374 70. Contrast life

in the country where the best dress is kept for the burial, and where
a white tunic is the distinction of the highest magistrate, with the
fopperies of dress and costly presents that the struggling man at

‘ Rome has to pay for with borrowed money, ll. 171-189.

Then again contrast‘the safety of life ina cottage with the dangers ol
a garret. The first floor may be in flames before the lodger under the
roof knows of it; and when he escapes, bumt out and ruined, no friend
comes to his aid; while the rich man is loaded with gifts from condoling
friends, who either need his patronage or expect a legacy, ll. 190-231.
lt takes wealth to shut out the sounds of city life, ll. 232-238. The
rich man is borne in his litter through the streets; the poor man has to
elbow his way, and may be crushed out of recognition by a stone falling
from a wahl, while his household are prepariug his food, 11. 239—267.
The night has its own dangers; the slops and erockery thrown out of
windows, the drunken rioters who stop the passer-by and pick a quarrel
with him, the burglar and the assassin, ll. 268-314. Juvenal must ask
his friend to visit him at Aquinum, when he goes there fora ‘villegg-
iatura,' ll. 315-322.

The friends then part; Umbricius going ofs with the waggon con· ·
taining‘his sumiture on his way to Cumae, and 'promising to visit
Juvenal at Aquinum.

This Satire was probably written about the same time as the first
,and second, most likely during Trajan's reign somewhere between 101 and
115A,D.

Dryden translated this Satire, and Boileau imitated it in two poems,
each of which deals with half of Juvenal's theme. Johnson has copied
it in his ‘Londom' Oldham has a close imitation of it, audit is trans·
lated into hendecasyllabis verse by Metastasio.

r. quamvis. Taken closely with confussus, ‘however much dise
tressed.' Oldham has
‘Though much concemed to lose my clear old friend’

confundo has in Plinyand Juvenal a weaker meaning thau it ³

bore in Vergil’s time. Weidner refers to Plin. Paneg. 86 ‘Quam ego
audio confusionem tuam fuisse, cum digredientem prosequereris! Words
like ¹ affliction' and ‘contrite' have suffered a similar change, as has
‘attonitus' in Latin.
