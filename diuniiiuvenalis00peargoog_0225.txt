SATIRE VIII.

aptly quotes Seu. Ep. lxxvi. 9 ⁴ ld in homine primum solumque est quo
et probatur et improbatur.'

3. Those ancestors who had enjoyed a triumph were naturally looked
on with the greatest pride: sometimes they were honoured with a
statue in the front court as in Sat. vii. 125. Sometimes they were
painted at full length standing in the triumphnl car.

Aemilianos. The younger Scipio when adopted by Scipio the
elder was P. Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus,

4. Μ. curius Dentatus, the conqueror of Pyrrhus.

umeros, a Greek construction, as in Sil. It. Punic. iii. 4² ‘ Achelous
frontem minor.' Quintilian notices the use of the acc. after adJ'ectives
as a Grecism, ix. 3. 17.

5. Μ. Valerius corvinus. See Sat. i. 96.

Galba, some ancestor of the Emperor who, as Suetonius tells 'us
in his Life, was fond of referring to Jove as his ancestor.

6-8. These verses are condemned by Weidner as an interpolation. The
repetition of Corvinus’ name seems harsh: the expression multa virga,
whether it means ‘a long wand' or ‘broom,’ or, as Lenis takes it,
‘through many a branch,’ is very obseure; and there is a meaningless
bathos in the descent from the ‘triumphales ’ to the mere tabula generis.

9. quo. ‘To what purposel’ So Cic. Pro Caelio ξ 53 ‘dixit profecto
quovellet aurum) effigies is the accus. cnse, cf. xiv. 56. 135. The sense
is, ‘what is the good of all these ancestors if you insult them by low
gambling before their very bustst' The Lepidi were of the illustrious
· gens Aemilia.'

13. ‘Why should a Fabius feel any pride in the descent he elaims
from his ancestor Q. Fabius Maximus Aemilianus (who defeated the
Allobroges nc, 121, and thence received the agnomen of Allobrogicus),
or feel pride in the Ara Maxima, dedicated by Evander to Hercules
(Verg. Aen. viii. 271), or in Hercules his legendary ancestor, if he has
degenerated into a vain and greedy weaklingi’

15. Euganea. The Euganean or Venetian wool was the most highly
prized for whiteness and delicacy. Cf. Mart. xiv. 155.

17. ‘He disgraces his shockhaired ancestors.’ Cf. Cowper's Garden,
‘Our forefathers‚ a grave whislrered race, but tasteless.’ traducere is
properly to ‘show off ’ to the people a disgraced malefactor. The word
is used in its original sense in Suet. Tit. 8. ad fin. ‘novissima traductos
per Amphitheatmm in arenam!

emptor. The busts of criminals were excluded from the right of
standing amongst the ‘imagines’ Nero, Tac. Ann. xvi. 7 ‘obiectavit
Cassio quod inter imagines maiorum etiam C. Cassi effigiem coluisset,
ita inscriptam “duci partium.'’ ⁹.

19-38. Virtue is the only true nobility. We judge of your character
by your achievements.

19. For the sentiment cf. Boileau, Sat. v. 41

‘On ne m’eblouit point d'une apparence vaine;
La vertu d'un coeur noble est la marque certaine.¹
