arra OF Juvawaa. 23

The lines in which he admits that none but the youngest boys
now believe the story of another world are a wail over the decay
of faith. We must accept the fact that no educated man could
be quite consistent in those days, and allow lor the fact that
Juvenal was illogical in worshipping at any altar. His real saith k
was undoubtedly such as Plato might have held. He believed
that there was a ruler of the universe and immutable laws ; that
there was a life after death ; and that a man determined his own
heaven or hell when he shaped his character. Beyond this, he
believed that it was good to cherish certain ancestral saiths3 and
he probably clung to these through habit a little more strongly
’ than he would have liked to admit. Montaigne thought that the
stigmata os St. Francis might be the effect of imagination, but
Montaigne took part determinately with the orthodox men of his
day against the iconoclasts. Pascal summed up for religion
altogether on the ground that you lost nothing and might gain
by believing in it, yet Pascal, who was always on the verge of
scepticism, accepted the miracle of the Holy Thom. Juvenal
lived in a society which was not unlike that of France in the
· times of Montaigne and Pasca13 like Montaigne he was a man
ol the world, like Pascal a fervid believer by temperament, and
like both, educated up toa point at which it was difficult to recon-
cile the demands of reason and saith.
‘ lf there are no godS,’ says Marcus AureliuS, ‘or if they do
not care for the concems of men, what does it profit to live in
a world that has neither gods nor Providence; but there are
gods, and they take thought sor the affairs of men; and they
have put it within everyone's power not to sall into real trouble’
(M. Aur. Ant. lib.ll.c. xi). Marcus Aurelius goes on to explain
that nothing can really affect a man’s happiness that does not ι
affect his character. That was Juvenal’s belief, to which he at· ,s
tained by the slowteaching of years. Grand as the lines sound in
which he exhorts the young noble to dcem it supreme impiety
to prefer existence to honour, and not to lose sor lise's sake
that which makes lile worth having, a close examination ol the
context will convince us that he thinks more of the unspotted
name than of the untainted soul. Similarly in Satire xiv henr
developcs a view kindred to that of modern science, that we are
all the trustees of future generations, and that if we sin we incur
