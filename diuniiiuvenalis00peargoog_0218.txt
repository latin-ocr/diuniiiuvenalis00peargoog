NOTES, ll. 93-123.

causidici were the pleaders in civil cases before the centumviri; the
eriminal cases came before the senate.

108. ipsi. ‘They are inclined enough of themselves to talk big
(about their sees), but especially if any chance creditor is by to listen to
them; or if one more really interested nudges them who comes to sue
with abig ledger for a doubtful debr! The first creditor may require
the lawyer’s services: and so it is worth while talking big to him: the
second appeals to him: and so it seems worth his while to talk even
bigger.

110. Weidner takes dubium nomento refer to the advocate himself.
Entry in the ledger before witnesses was the legal proof of debt: cf.
Cicero, Fam. ix. 10. 1. Cf. also a note by Longon Cic. Vcrr. ii. 1. 38.

111. ¹ Then they tell greater lies than ever, and spit to avert the punish·
ment.’ It was usual to spit three times to avoid this ‘fascinum' Cf.
Plin. N. H. xxviii. 7; Theoc. ii. 62; Tylor, Primitive Man, vol. ii. pp.
397 and 400·

114. Lacaena, the auriga of ‘the red.' He refers to one of the four
‘sactions’ in the circus, of which there were four—the albata, russata,
veneta, and prasina: the white, the red, the blue, and the green. The
Roman peopie interested themselves for the success of one or other of
these factions, much as an English crowd would do for ‘a stable' in
modern times. The ‘aurigae’ were in the pay of the praetor, who richly
'rewarded the most successful. Vopisc. Aurel'. 15· says ‘that he had
seen whole patrimonies lavished in presents bestowed on these aurigae?

115. This is a parody on Ovid, Met. xiii. 1-2, where Ajax rises to
essert his claim as against Ulysses to the arms of Achilles z ‘You differ,
however, from Ovid's Ajax in that you turn pale'

116. ‘You have to act as advpcate for one who is claimed as a slave: ’
a bumpkin is judge? It would seem as if this case were conducted before
a single judge and not a court or ‘iudicium’

118. We see from Martial, vii. 28. 5, that lawyers who had won a
case used to deck their house doors with evergreens. This lawyer lives
in lodgings and has only his staircase to deck.

119. petasunculus, dim. of ‘petaso' ‘the pestle’ of bacon: Lewis
quotes Martial, xiii. 55, to show that it was one of the usual presents-
sent to strangers and guests. Cf. also Pers. iii. 75, who says that the
Marsian client paid in pepper and hams.

120. Maurorum epimenia. ‘The ratione of negroes:' Moorish
slaves. bulbi, probably some kind of ‘ onion.’

121. ‘ Wine which came down the Tiberi—not imported from S. Italy,
whence came the best wine—‘he will give you full five flagons of that!

122. The whole trial entails four ‘actiones’ The aureus=1oo
sesterces

123. ‘From this the attomey'sfees have to come off by the covcnant.'
The pragmatici were men whose business it was to be well versed in
the law to explain it to the pleaders. They were not allowed to speak

in court. ·Cf. Quint. iii. 6. 59.
