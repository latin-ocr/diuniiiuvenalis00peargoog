ΟΝ THE WICKEDNESS OF ROME.

Trta first Satire of Juvenal is one of the most vigorous in detached
passages and the most clumsily constructed as a whole. It looks as if
he had written two different prefaces at various times and had then
decided to weld them together. It is the work of a genuine rhetorician,

scathing and lucid in style, but loose‚ inharmonious, inconsistent in
construction. In the first portion, which apparently ends at 1. 80, but
of which n. 147-171 were no doubt a part, he supposes himself
replying to an imaginary friend who wishes to dissuade him from
writing. Juvenal pleads, ll. 1—18‚ that he is pestered by poets of every
quality who deal with nnreal themes, and it is absurd for one who has
mastered the craft not to say what he is full of. But why write a satire?
ll. 19—21. How is it possible not to write a satire when the real world
is througed with such grotesque and foul shapes, when the eunuch
marrying a wife, the female gladiator, the prosperous informer, the
wealthy parasite, the wretch who sells his virility, and the despoiler of
a province, are the first forms revealed by the lantern of truthr ll. 22-51.
Are the stories of Hercules, and TheseuS, and Daedalus more wonderful
than the tale of how one may make a fortune by his wife's shame‚ and
another expects a commission for having squandered his estate in the
stables? ll. 52-61. Could you not fill a book at the crossings, as one
litter carries past you the wealthy forger and another the matron of good
family who belonged to the club for poisoning husbands? The lesson
of life is that wealth is only acquired by crimes at which the blood boils,
aad which force indignation to speak out in verse, ll. 62-80.

The construction now changes, and Juvenal explains that he is
writing a book to describe human wishes and passione and feelings
since man was born into the world, ll. 81-86. He seems to promise
a description of various vices, but instead of this we have an elaborate
complaint of the poverty of the nobility, together with the description of
the hard lot of a client. For when was material more abundant?
When was the gambling instinct stronger? or the insolence and
worship of wealth more marked? We have done all but build
temples to money, and what remains sor the people but to starve i'f
