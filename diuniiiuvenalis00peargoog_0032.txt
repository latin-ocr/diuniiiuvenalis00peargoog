greatness of Rome for centuries. Thoughtful men who looked
round them under the Empire, and who saw agovemment that
rested on force, and a society that only respected wealth, might
well ask themselves if any single cause contributed more to the
decay of the Empire than the degradation of the nobility. That
the emperors had risen above the restraints of public opinion,
and that they exacted some actof flagrant indecency from the
heirs of noble names as a guarantee that they did not meditate
reforms‚ might easily seem to a patriotic gentleman who mixed

when Honoratus pleaded for him before the troops he did it by
recapitulating Nero’s crimes in the same order as Juvenal.
‘Has Galba murdered his own mother or his wife ?· Or has he
made you ashamed of your Emperor by appearing as a fiddler
