140. ο delicias! ‘My fanciful friend? Cf. ri. 47.

141. gallinae. Because white heus were held by the Romans not to
be prolific, and hence their progeny would be exceptional. Columella,
&humma

144. si flectas. The subjunctive prefers a request. ‘If you would
turn your eyes’ etc. ,

146. The door being on fire would prove that the fire was designed
so that no one could escape.

150. haec. ·11 these costly things are not there 1ο steal, you geta
sacrilegious thief on a smaller scale, why should he hesitatel 'tis
common to melt down an entire image of the Thuuderer.' Probably
there is a reference here to some notorious crime of the day of which we
are not aware.

151. bratteolam or bracheolam is a tuin leaf of gold, as expressed
by the diminutive.

154. artifices, to be talren closely with ‘veneni' the apothecaries

notices, is from a ship.

156. The punishment of parricides. Cf. Sat. viii. 214.

157. The ‘ custos urbis’ is the ‘praefectus urbi’ His duties embraced
almost all the crinrinaljurisdiction of Rome. C. Rutilius Gallicus was
‘praefectus urbi' under Domitiam so, if this Satire was not written till
some thirty years after Domitian's death, we must suppose that Gallicus
is used as the type of a class.

160. ‘Spend a few days in Gallicus‘ house, and then venture to call
yourself wretched)

162. tumidum guttur. The goltre, still common among the in-

165. Weidner takes torquentem as ‘the man who twists,' as if it
were ‘et si quern hominem videat madido cirro cornua torquentem.' It
seems simpler to take it with ‘ caesaries‚‘ which is itself said ‘torquere
comua,’ lit. ‘their hair which twists the tufts of its moistened curls.'
Tac. Germ. 38 tells us ‘insigne gentis obliquare crinem nodoque sub·
stringere? They combed their hair back aud gathered it into a homlike
knot; they also dyed and moistened their hair with a kind of soap,
which explains ‘madidus' see Plin. N. H. xxviii. ξ 191.

168. The Pygmies were supposed to live in India, or at the sources
of the Nile: the cranes wage incessant war against them by rifling their
fields. Cf. Homer, Il. iii. 7. Verg. Georg. i. 120 talks of ‘ Strymoniae
grues.¹ On the legend of the Cranes and Pygmies see Sayce, Intro·
duction to the Science of Language vol. ii. p. 266.
