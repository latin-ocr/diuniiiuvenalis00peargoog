SATIRE VIII.

accompanied a provincial governor into his province and formed, as we
should say, his staff. Cf. Hor. Ep. i. 8 and Cic. Verr. ii. 27.

128. homanorum, an epithet of Phoebus, Homer, ΙΙ. ii. 39. ‘No

young Lovelocks.' Juvenal's own slave was close cropped (Sat. xi. 149).

in coniuge. Tacitus, Ann. iv. 20, tells us that the behaviour of
the wives of provincial govemors was so bad, and their avarice so
excessive, that the governors were by law rendered responsible for the
bebavionr of their wives. Cf. also Ann. iii. 33.

129. conventus, as we should say, ‘assize towns,’ places appointed
by the governor to hold courts in. Each province was' divided into a
certain number of these ‘conventus' or ‘iurisdictiones'

130. Celaeno, the eldest of the harpies. Cf. Verg. Aen. iii. 210.

131. ‘If you are pure and just you may claim Picus the son of Saturn
as your ancestor.’ For Picus, the first king of Latium, cf. Verg. Aen. vii.
48. The sentiment is similar to that in Pope's Essay 011 Man Ep. iv. 211

‘What cau ennoble sotS, or slaves, or cowardsf
Alasl not all the blood of all the Howards!

139· The same sentiment is in Sallust, Ing. lxxxv. 22.

140. Lewis q'uotes Sen. Oct. 575 ‘Maiora populus semper a summo
exigit! Julius Caesar’s maxim was, ‘ lta in maxima fortuna minuma
licentia est? Cf. also Pope, Essay on Man, Ep. iv. 267

‘Painful preeminencel yourself to view
Above life's weakness‚ and its comforts too?

14²· When quo is used like ‘quorsum' an ellipse of some word
commonly follows. Here it would be something like ‘narras' cf.
Hor. Ep. i. 5.12 ‘Quo mihi fortunam si non conceditur util‘ Wills
were commonly kept for safety in temples: the forger is here repre·
sented as committing sacrilege as well as forgery.

144. Montaigne, in his Essay on Prayers, quotes this passage and
developes the thought.

145. Santonico, ‘pa cowl’ made at Saintonge in Aquitaine. The
‘cucullus Santonicus' was the same as the ‘bardocucullus’ a rough
cloak, with a hood, covering the whole body.

146-182. Some who should be the true leaders of the people turn
coachmen, and behave so, that, if they were slaves, they would be put
into the slaves‘ prison.

146. The poet now proceeds to depict the degeneracy of the Roman
aristocracy, their propensity to racing and low company. The fact that
driving oneself was considered a vice is characteristic of an age when
slaves were employed for everything.

147. Probably an example taken from the life. Weidner thinks
of a T. Sextius Magius Lateranus, consul 94 Ab. under Domitian.

148. multo sufflamine, ‘with the heavy drag;‘ the word is used
metaphorically xvi. 50. See Rich s. v.

149. ‘The moon and stars are so ashamed that they strain their eyes

with astonishment as they behold it.' The phrase seems formed on the
analogy of ‘intendere aures)
