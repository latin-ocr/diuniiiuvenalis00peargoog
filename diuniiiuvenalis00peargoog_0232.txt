, NOTES, ll. 127-168.

152. trepidabit. A word commonly used intransitively, but here
used transitively, like Shakspeare's ‘to bay the moon.' The usage is
post-classical.

153. iam senis ; and therefore worthy of the more respect.

virga. Apuleius in his Florida 21 describes this salute, ‘virgam
in laevam manum transferunt itaque expedita dextra adeunt ac salu-
tant)

¹55· interea. ‘Meanwhile during his actual consulship, while he is
actually performing the solemn sacrifice at the “feriae Latinae‚‘' when
the consuls yearly sacrifieed a steer to Jupiter Latiaris, he thinks of
nothing but horseflesh.' Weidner shows that robus was used merely
for ‘robustus'

157. Epona. The goddess of horses: as Bubona was the goddess of
oxen. The letter ‘p’ is often found in the Italian dialects as repre-
seuting Latin qu or k. It must not, however, be assumed with Corssen,
i. 115, that Indo-European k can ever be held to represent the Latin p.
Thus, besides ‘Epona’ and ‘popina’ we find ‘palumbes' not of Latin
but of Oscau origiu; while‘ poena' is of course of Greek origin-see
Handbuch d. k. A. Wissenschaft p. 172: thus Oscan po, Gr. πο· in πῶς
=‘quo,' cf. sequ· with ἕπομαι, and pis iu Sabine=‘quis:’ just as ἵππος
-- ‘equus' the older form being ἵκκος, aud ‘popina‘ in v. 158 answering
to ‘coquina’ In Apuleius, Met. 27, we leam that the hero of his romanoe
found in his stable ⁴ Eponae deae simulacrum residens aedicula!

The ‘facies pictae’ are the portraits of the goddess rudely painted iu

the stable.

160. Rejected by Weidner on the ground of the difficulty involved in
Idumeae portae. The pass between Cilicia and Syria (pylae Syriae)
could hardly be meant. He seems to think of the Orient generally;
and to speak of Idumea, the ancient Edom‚ ns the ‘porta' to Arabia.
Cf. porta Syenes xi. 124.

161. The Oriental welcomes him with all the airs and graces of a
well-bred host, and the dancing girl offers him refreshments.

168. The exact meaning of thermarum calices is matter of doubt.
It probably refers to the warm drinks sold in the public taprooms
attached to the thermae; cf. xi. 4. Here the riff-rafl of Rome used to
gather and carry on their orgies; cf. Plautus, Curc. ii. 1310, etc.

inscripta lintea probably refers to the scrolls or ‘ tituli' set over
the liquor shops to attract the notice of guests. ‘inscriptio' was the
regular word for a shop sign; cf. Plin. Ep. v. 19. 3. The sense ie,
‘Lateranus is strong enough and young enough to defend the Roman
frontiers and to guard the Emperor's person. Send him to Ostia,
Caesar, (whence he must embark for his expedition), but you will have
to pick him out of some low pothouse.’ Some have taken it as referring
to the mouths of the rivers mentioned, but Ι prefer the interpretation
given. ‘Ostia' was used indifferently as feminine singular (no doubt
from ‘urbs’ being thought of in connection with the word), or as neuter
plural.
