17. Lateranorum. Plautius Lateranus, who, like Seneca, suffered
death sor joining in Piso's conspiracy from patriotic motives. Tacitus,
Ann. xv. 60, says ‘Illo propinqua vespera tribunus venit et villam globis
militum saepsit.¹ His palacewas on the Caelian mount. The change ot
tense from clausit to obsidet gives a picture. The soldiers have
