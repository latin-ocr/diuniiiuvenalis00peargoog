sarran lv.

Again the monster Crispinus! who committed incest with a vestal
¹ virgin, ll.1—10,but this poem only deals with a minor offence against
morals, though one the censor would notice in any other person, the pur·
chase of a mullet for 6000 sesterces simply sorbis own eating, ll. 11—27.
When the buffoon of the palace sared in this way, what must the Emperor
have indulged in, ll. ²8·32· Sing the true story, ye Virgin Muses, 33-36·

In Domitian's time a fisherman at Ancona catches a turbot as bigas
are found in the Black Sea, ll. 372443 he thinks it safer to make a merit
ol offering it to the Emperor, and finds him at his Alban pala0e‚ 11. 45-
62 ; the fish is let in while the Senators are kept waiting outside, ll. 60-71 ;
but as there is no dish big enough to hold it, a Council is summoned in
hot haste, 11. 72-75. Pegasus comes first. the upright lawyer, but too
constitutional sor times out oi joint, ll. 76-81; next Crispus, well-in·
tentioned, but too timid to stake his lile on the truth, ll. 81-933 then
Acilius, with his son doomed to death by his eminence‚ 94-103 ; then
the profligate and foul-mouthed Rubrius and sat Montanus, and Cris·

' pinus reeking with seent, and Pompey the informer and Fuscus brooding

over war, and blind Catullus with the tricks os a roadside beggar who
loved the woman and praised the fish he could not see, 11. 94—129. The
opinion oi Montanus that a special dish be made for the turbot prevails
as that of an expert, 11. 130-143. Hereupon the Council is dismissed, its
important public functions having been discharged, 11. 144—149.

Would to God Domitian had spent his time in these trifles rather than
in butchering the nobility! 11. 150-154.

This Satire, it will be seen, is composed of two parts. which seem
but slightly, aud somewhat inartistically, connected with each other.
The inartistic and incoherent way in which the pictures of Roman
lise which the Satirist brings before us are connected, is seen in this
Satire as markedly as in the first. The first part, 1-33, deals with
Crispinus: the rest, 37-154, with Domitian's degrading tyranny.
The thought which connects the two is found in ll. 28, 33 ‘If the
servant indulges in such unrestrained luxury, what may we not
,expect from the masterl’ Weidner supposes that the two portions of
this Satire were originally two separate Satires, united into one by some
blunder or accident.

1. 0000 iterum crispinus! Juvenal certainly has mentioned
Crispinus in i. 26: but it seems questionable whether these words do
not imply that the whole of a previous Satire, now lost, had been devoted
to him. Heinrich suggests that the words may have passed into a
proverb3 possibly dating from some old satirist like Lucilius. ‘Here
we are again with Crispinus l’ He appears, from the passage noticed in
Satire i, and from lines 24, 32, to have been an Egyptian born. Now
Augustus had expressly commanded that no Egyptian should have a
seat in the Roman senate ; and this law was strictly observed down to
