6 PREFACE.

important work has been lately translated into English, but
the translation was published too late to permit os the
quotations being made from the English edition. The
editors have, however, freely quoted from it.

The editions of Juvenal are numerous especially those
published in England and Germany. To pass over the
oldest editions, Henninius availed himself ol the labours ol
Britannicus, Pithoeus, Rigaltius, and Grangaeus‚ and brought
'out his text with a commentary at Leyden in 1695, Ruperti
brought out an edition even fuller than that of Henninius at
Leipzig in 18013 and followed this by two later editions
published in 1819 and 1820. The French editor Achaintre
published a commentary in two volumes at Paris in 1810,
chiefly valuable for his communication of different readings
drawn from Paris MSS. Juvenal was edited and commented
on by E. W. C. Weber (Weimar, 1825). In 1830 Madvig pub·
lished his‘Disputatio de locis aliquot luvenalis explicandis'
(Copenhagen), which was followed by ‘Disputatio altera' .
in 1842, and by his ‘Adversaria critica ad Scriptores Latinos'
in 1873. In 1838 Weber published a translation and
notes, and in the following year Heinrich published an
edition at Bonn containing the Aneient Scholia, An
edition with English notes was published by Stocker in ,

1845 (London). Other usesul works on Juvenal are

locos interpretandos' (Berlin, 1843); Roth, ‘Zu Iuvenalis
