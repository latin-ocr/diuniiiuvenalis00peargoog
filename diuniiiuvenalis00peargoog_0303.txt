SA T [RE XVI.

aa sq. ‘Besidea it would be difficult to find awitness in yourcase: he
would have to live far away from the praetoriana in town and to be
a very Pylades.’

aa. Weidner understands vindicta oi the verdict given against the
soldier, which is rendered by his comrade ‘curabilis,’ i.e. ‘consolatory'
to him, by all kinds of persoual attentioris and chieily by injurie
inilicted on you as a civilian.

²3· The mule was the type ol stupidity. Ci. Catull. lxxxiii. 3 ‘mule
nihil sentis,’ and Plaut. cist. iv. 2. 12 ‘mulo inscitior! Vagellius is
mentioned in the same way in xiii. 119.

26. ‘That hewould dare to penetrate the agger-and pass intothe camp?

²9· ‘If the president says, Produoe your witness! and the witness
dares to appear, I should class him with the ancient worthies os Rome.'
Varro expressly tells us that barbers were not introduced into Italy till
lac. 30⁰3 hence we often find long hair spoken oi as a symbol of archaic
simplicity. Cf. Hor. Od. ii. 15. 11 ‘intonsi Catonis!

33. paganus. Properly, as we have seen, used oi a provincial
civilian; though sometimes used even ol a ‘civis Romanus? Cf. Plin.
Ep. Traian. 8613 ‘et milites et pagani.’

34. fortunam, ‘his interest;' pudorem, ‘his honour.’

35. ‘Another advantage enjoyed by soldiers is that their suits are
soon settled.’ .

38. suorum saxum, the Terminus, honoured at the Terminalia iu
February with offerings oi cake and spelt.

4¹· Alleging that the signatore is worthless and the tablet useless; as
we might say, that the signature is not worth the paper on which it is
written. The same line occurs in Satire xiii. 137.

42. ‘We shall have to wait a whole year besore the suits of the entire
nation are considered ;' the meaning surely is that we shall find the civil
courts so lull oi long-standing cases that we, and with us the whole
nation, are waiting to begin ours.

43. huncquoque, ‘even then, ii our cause does come on.’

44. ‘'Ihe cushions are put ou the bench by the apparitorea but
nothing more is done.’

45. The advocates are actually getting ready to speak, and putting
off the ‘lacerna’ which they wore outside the ‘toga’ as they had to
appear in court in the ‘toga’ the distinctive dress os the Roman citizen.

47. ‘And thus we fight our lawsuits in the dilatory lists of the law
court?

51-60. A third privilege os soldiers is that they have a right to the
‘peculium castrense,’ whether their father be alive or not ; and hence

their fathers are more than ordinarily considerate iu their treatment of
them.

52. During the lifetime oi the father the son is not ‘sui iuris,’ and
possesses therefore no property os his own. On the other hand, uo one
can touch the ‘peculium castrense' os the soldier; and, is he sees fit.
he cau bequeath it to his father or to any one else.
