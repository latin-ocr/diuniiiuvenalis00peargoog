PREFACE.

Tun object of the editors has been to produce an edition
⁸ ol Juvenal which may prove of use in aiding the students at
our Schools and Universities to appreciate and understand
the great Roman Satirist. They have been very anxious to
try and follow the train of thought in each satire, and to cite
parallel passages from classical authors where it has appeared
that real light was thrownflby such quotations upon the passage
before the reader. They have not always quoted at length, for
fear of rendering the volume too bullry. They have found,
’ ol existing editions, Weidner's among the most useful,and
have frequently borrowed from his scholarly Commentary,
now, unfortunately, out of print. ,
Professor Mayor’s Commentary should be in the hands ol '
every student of Juvenal. The wealth of material supplied

‘Alterttimer‚' Becker's ‘Gallus' Bdttiger's ‘Sabina’ Rich's
Manual‚ Guhl and Koner's ‘Life of the Romans,’ will a'll b'e
found to throw much light on the manners and customs
described by Juvenal. To these should be added, Leclys
‘History of European Morals3’ and, for some interesting
information on questions of natural history connected with
Italy, Hehn's ‘Culturpflanzen und Hausthiere in ihrem
llbergang aus Asien nach Griechenland und Italien sowie
in das tibrige Europa. Historisch·linguistische Skizzen.' This
