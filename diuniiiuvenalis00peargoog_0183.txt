SATIRE III.

81. conchylia, ‘ bright purple robes' unworthy oi a Roman, and ac·
tually forbidden by several sumptuary laws to men to wear.

82. ‘Shall I see foreign opstarts preferred to a genuine Roman like
myself as witnesses and guestsi’ For the rank of guests at table see
Horace, Ep. ii.; viii. 22 sq. Tbere was sometimes a ‘ nomenclator' to
assign their places to guests; see Athenaeus 2. ²9 (quoted by Marq.).

83. Damascus plums (damsons) and small Syrien figs, which were
imported into Rome via Alexandria.

85. ⁴ I was rearcd on the Aventine, in the heart oi Rome, on Sabine sare'
(ci. l. 169), which was the simplest and produced the finest men. Ci.
Vergil’s ‘pubem Sabellam’ Georg. ii. 167. baca is the ‘olive berry!

88. ‘They are actually adroit enough in their flattery to compare
the long-drawn neck oi an invalid to a hero at the time when he is at
the supreme moment of his exertion‚ holding the giant above the earth!
This was the savourite attitude ol the poets in which to describe wrestlers;
ci. Lucan iv. 617 ; Stat. Theb. vi. 893.

91. ille = ‘gallus' = ‘vox galli, sc. mariti? Here the ‘gallus' stands ior
a quality attributed to it, a nse found only aiter an adjective oi com·
parison, as ‘ Isaeus’ in l. 74 stood ior ‘sermo Isaei.’ ‘He is in ecstasies
at the squeaky voice than which the voice oi the cock does not sound
more paltry.’ The ablative ‘quo marito' is a sort oi ablative of atten-
dant circumstances serviug almost as an adjective ; cf. ‘quo tondente
gravis iuveni mihi barba cadebat' Sat. i. ²5· ¹

92. ‘Certainly we conflatte13 but they get credit ior their flattery,
while we do not!

93. ‘An melior est simulator curn comoedus agit muliebres personas
quam in vera vita l’ ‘The Greek, we all know, is perfectiou itseli as a
playe13 now tell me whether he is not as good in playing a part in daily
lisel He is so good that even off the stage he plays as well as he plays
on it 3 and his perfectiori iu playing female parts is so great that
you would say he was a real woman. He is equally at honre in the part
oi a witty hetaira like Thais, or of a chaste wite, or of a waiting-maid,
so trim without her tippet.’ The servant wears her ‘tunica' only, with-
out the ‘palliolum’ or short mantle, which she has doffed from coquetry. ·

98. noo tomen. ‘ Yet, although these Greeks are such good amors,

they are not much better than the rest: a natiou oi comedians, ,

and able to appreciate good acting‚ they would not appreciate the best
actors who cannot act better than every Greek cau act! A variant
‘ tantum' ior ‘ tamen ’ is noticed by Weidner with approval. ‘Not even
can an Antiochus vie with them' Quintilian, xi. 3. 178, notices Demetrius
aud Stratocles ‘placere diversis virtutibus! Demetrius played grave and
majestic parts, such as those of gods and mothers ofsamilies. Stratocles
was strong iu the parts oi tricky slaves, parasites, etc.

100. rides. The hypothetical protasis is here stated as a fact, and
is by an artifice os rhetoric regarded as realised. In Greek this is
commonly introduced by καὶ di: cf. Aesch. Eumenides 854 erui δὴ
δέδεγμαι. τίς δέ μοι τιμὴ μένει ; Aristoph. Vespae 1224, etc..
