sanguis. Snrely ‘sanguis' does not here mean ‘the high-bred
one,' as is commonly assumed. ‘Taurus' seems to be the nominative
to ‘traheretur’ and ‘iret;¹ and ‘sangnis' and ‘cervix‘ simply repeat
the idea of ‘tauma’ specialising, however, the features in the bull which
would naturally present themselves to the ‘popa’ or priest’s servant.
Thus we might translate, ‘there should be a bnll to drag along
whose very latness made him slew-a bull reared in no neighbouring
fields, bnt he should go, his blood giving proof oi Clitumnns’ rich
pastores—he should go blood and all, and his neck challenging the blow
of a tall sacrificet) The ⁴ popa’ mnst be tall to bring down such a
victim. ‘Sanguis' is to be joined with ‘ostendens ;’ the word might be
paralleled by the dealer's expression ‘a bit of.blood.’

14. The use ol ‘ab' and the ablative is nncommon aiter the gerimdive,
which requires the dative ol the agent. The use ol prepositions was,
however, commonet in the language ol the people than in classical
Latin; and this use became common in late Latin.

17. ‘Wondering even yet that he was saved,¹ like Don Juan, who,
aster his shipwreck,

‘ganed as one who is awoke
By a distant orgen, doubting il he be
Not yet a dreamer.'

passage in mind.

, aa. velis ardentibus, a condensed expression, characteristic ol Ι
Juvenal, lor‘ a shipwreck' m a ship with burning sails’ Any ship·
wreck, they said, was dreadsul, but to be shipwrecked by the sails
catching fire was shipwreck of the worst kind.

²3· A sneer at the poets ‘Everything occurs as regularly and as
dreadsully as the poets could describe.’ Cf. Luk. Πῶς δεῖ ἱστορίαν σογ-
γρόφειν( (chap. 45 ;) Δεήσει γὰρ τότε ποιητικοῦ τινος ἀνέμου’ ετουριάσοντος

generally mentioned· by the poets, i..e he lost his goods and chattels to
lighten the ship.

²5 quamquam ariseslrom the additional the indefinite‘ quam' to
the interrogative use of the word ‘in what way ξ’ so that the word

,strictly speaking means ‘in what way soever.' It thus answers to the
so·called general relatives, and, like these, is commonly used with the
indicative; though, like these, it was very commonly used with the
subjunctive in later writers, and always in Juvenal; in lact, the con-
junctive aiter ‘quamquam’ is a characteristic of the Latinity ol the
Silver age ;—it is common in Pliny and Tacitus.
