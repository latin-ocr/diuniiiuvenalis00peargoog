54 · ἸΝΤΚΟΒΗΟΤΙΟΜ

the return of Manlius from his plundering razzia in Asia in
189 A.D.¹ Carthage, Corinth, and Macedonia were speedily

brought under subjection‚ and their wealth and un-Roman
tastes came with the conquered to Rome.

Antonius and his orientals continued the work of degenera-
tion; and by the time of Augustus Athe capital was fairly de-
nationalised-genuine ltalians were replaced by a mixed rabble
gathered from half the world. The rich grew daily richer; the

,ι poor sank daily more and more into obscurity‚ dependence and
hopelessness. N owhere was the eontrast between poverty and
wealth so striking as at Rome. The influente of the stern and .
simple religion os ancient Rome was killed by the influx os
foreigners with their strange and wild superstitions. The capital
teemed with Syrien and Cappadocian priests, Armenian sooth-
,sayers, Phrygian augurs, ballet-girls from Spain, Egyptian

ψ ·l0rtune-tellers, and adventurers of all kinds from Greece. The ’
fascinating and supple ‘Greekling’ was everywhere and was

. everythingintum. At once intellectually superior and morally

more unscrupulous than the Roman, he fostered the worst pas·
sions of his employer, made himself a necessity, and roseto
the highest and most confidential employments. Greek fashions
and habits became models sor the men and women os Rome, and

’ to talk Greek, or at least to interlard conversation with Greek
phrases, was indispensable for an Italian who would pass sor

well-bred. Many of the foreigners who were so potent at Rome
were freedmen, and the predominance of this claSS, possessing .
as it did all the vices learnt in slavery, was amongst the most
banesul effects of the foreign infusion. The complete absence
of police supervision and the constant dread of famine in which
the populace lived rendered the presence of these foreignerS,
unaccustomed to sels-restraint, more dangerous and baneful still.
To these general causes must be added the demoralising
example ol the Imperial Court, whose commanding influente in
the early Empire made itsell felt in Roman society almost wholly
sor evil. Low intrigue, insatiable avarice hand in hand with
&sreckless extravagance, gluttony, rapine, cruelty, such were the
main characteristics of the govemment of the Emperors from
Tiberius to Domitian. Even those who had given sair promise
