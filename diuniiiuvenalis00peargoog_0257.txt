SATIRE XI.

liciae;’ cs. Ovid, Trist. iii. 13. ¹3· ‘Natales celebrare' is to keep one's
birthday; cf. Pliny, Ep. vi. 30. 1.

85. For the offeret ate what he did not burn.

88. ‘He would not hare departed from the common custom but ior
a special occasion?

89. ‘His spade on his shoulder.' domare was a common expression
ior bringing land under cultivation, like ἡμερόω in Greek.

90. But when men looked with awe upon their censore: nay, when
one censor actually dreaded the authority oi another, as M. Livius
Salinator did that of C. Claudius Nero. See Livy xxix. 37 and Valer.
Max. ii. 9. 6.

95. The ⁴ fulcra' were stout props to beds adorned with representatione
oi quaint monsters, such as griffins and sphinxes. Cf. Pliny H. N. xxxiv.
2; Propert. ii. ro. ²5 ‘Nec mihi tunc fulcro sternatur lectus eburno!

96. nudo latere. Iu prose we should expect ‘sed parvus lectus nudo
latere ostendebat fronte aerea vile caput’

nudum latus and frons aerea are both parts os the lectus,
but as special attention is to be paid to the ‘frons aerea’ the poet
makes it the nominative, ancl connects ‘nudo latere' and ‘parvis
lectis’ with it as ablativos of quality3 ‘buton beds of plain un·
ornamented sides and small, there was a brass headpiece‚ which dis-
played a cheap ass’s head, crowned with vines, at which the wauton
country boys were laughing.’ The ass is crowned with vine-leaves to
commemorate, it is said, the invention of pruning vines from watch-
ing its browsing. cf. Hehn‚ p. 108 ‘Mit der Wein- und Oel-Kultur

ging auch der Esel nach Nordeu,’ the ass followed the vine and olive to

, the north, etc. Some understand the pueri to be the guests3 but it

seems better to take the word of the children playiug round the bed iu the
‘atrium’ Cf. xiv. 108 ‘infantes ludebant quattuor, unus Vemula, tres
domini.’

roo. Juvenal is here tempted by his wish to give a distinct picture
into a description of the barbarity, rather than the simplicity‚ oi the
Romans of whom he speaks. Polybius was present at the taking of
Corinthiae. 146, and he tells us that he was told of those who had
seen ἐρριμμένους πίνακας ἀπ’ ἐδάφους, πεττεύοντας δὲ rui τοὺς στρατιώτας
ἐπὶ τούτων xl. 7. .

genitive of possession.

geminos Quirinos, ie. ‘Romulum et Remum3’ just as ‘Cas-
