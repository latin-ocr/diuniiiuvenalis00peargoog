NOTES, ll. 81-114.

ror. neo dolet, ‘and yet he feels uo grief? ‘Nec' for ¹ nec tamen!
Cf. ‘ita occulte temperatur ut impleat nec! redundet' Plin. Ep. v. 6.

103. ἑνδρομίς is in Greek ‘a hunting boot,' only used of the boots
worn by Artemis: in Latin it has the meaning of a warm overcoat
which athletes cast over them after their exercises. ’

104. non eumue. This line is omitted by Weidner, and enclosed
in brackets by most editors. (1) It breaks the connection between
‘natio comoeda est’ and what follows; (a) ‘semper' is weak; (3) it
is a question whether the phrase ‘omni nocte dieque' is Latin.

105. vultum. ‘He can put on an expression to match* the other's
face! The ‘vultus' is the changing expression: the ‘facies' the ,un-
changing lineaments of the face. He can therefore take his cue from
the cast of his auditor’s features.

108. trulla, ‘a small ladle‘ or ‘ scoop' for dipping wine out of the
‘crater’ or ‘vas vinarium ;' sometimes of clay, as in Hor. Sat. ii. 3. 143.
Weidner thinks that the Greek is represented as wanting also to dip
wine; but the master plays him the triclr of emptying the crater, and
placing it before him empty. The Greek, in his zeal for flattery, not
noticing this, strikes the bottom of the crater with the ‘aurea trulla)
and instead of showing resentment at the trick, pays the master a com-
pliment on his clevemess at a ruse. Others, taking ‘trulla’ asa ‘drinking
cup‚' explain that if the master tums his glass over to show that it is
empty, and the last drops escape with a gurgling sound, the parasite
goes into ecstacies even at this. And this seems the simpler interpre-
tation.

114-118. Weidner, following Teuffel, thinks it probable that these
verses are a late interpolation after Tacitus, who, in Ann. xvi. 21-33,
gives an account of the trial of Thrasea Paetus and Barea Soranus.
Soranus,a man of position, was accused by a philosopher of Berytus,
one Celer. Egnatius was rewarded; Soranus was put to death: one of
the charges against him was that of causing his daughter Servilia to
use magio arts. Ritter, followed by Mayor, adopts the reading ‘discipu-
lamque senex’ here, in order to make au antithesis between the ‘senex'
and his disciple.

114. eoepit, in perfect tense, as Lucr. R. N, v. 14.

transi gymnasia: ‘pass over, overlook the crimes of the boys'
schools: and let us look at the wickednees of an accepted philosopher?
These gymnasia or high schools are mentioned as hotbeds of vice
by Seneca, De Brev. Vitae xii. 2. The Ephebi wore the chlamys or
‘minor abolla‚’ Apuleius, Met. x: the philosophers the ‘maior abolla!
Mayor, less probably, refers the words about the gymnasia to ll.
67, 68, making the sense, ‘Let us pass by the gymnasia, and the
shameful habit of copying the Greeks even in our athletics, and now
come to a crime maioris togae, i.e. sceleris potioris? In ¹either case
it must be admitted that the transition is somewhat brusque from 113
to 114.
