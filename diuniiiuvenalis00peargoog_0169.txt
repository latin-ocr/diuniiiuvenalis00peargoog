SA TIRE Ι.

farrago, ‘hotch·potch,' properly of spelt (far); the word is used
with reference to the meaning of ‘satura'

88. sinus. Usually taken as the sold of the toga which formeda
pocket for the purse; thus Avarice is represented as opening wide her
purse for more. Others have taken it of ⁴ a sail' It seems more pro-
bable that the word is here used in the sense of ‘an abyss’ Weidner ”
appositely quotes Sen. Oed. 595 ‘subito dehiscit terra et immenso sinu
laxata patuit!

89. hos animos (i. e. habuit). The omission of the verb is usual in
the conversational style; cf. Sen. Troad. 348 ‘Agant¹ Hos Scyrus animos?
Pyrrh. Scelere quae fratrum caret.' ‘Animos ¹ =‘spirits,' ‘life'

enim simply strengthens ‘neque’ ‘nor indeed! In common with
‘nam’ and ‘nempe' it seems to be connected with the root ‘gnis’
found in ‘gna-rus ;’ aud its original signification must have been ‘you ·
must know,' ‘to wit?

loculis, ‘a small hagor satchel,’ here used for ‘a purse.¹

90. arca is ‘the money-chest.'

91. The dispensator, or ‘house-steward‘ who keeps his accounts,
serves as his ‘squire‘ in the battle of the gaming table, and finds
him the wcapons, i. e. the money. Cf. Becker, Gallus ii. 118.

9²· simplexne furor. ‘ Is it a common, every-day madnessl’ The
phrase puts usin mind of ‘insanire putas communia,’ etc. ; Horace, Ep.
r.1. 101.

93. reddere implies that¹ the tunic was theslave's due; ‘reddere'

means to give that which you are for some reason expected or bound
to give, Orell. ad Hor. Epp. ii. 1. 2163 cf. the expression ‘reddere
rura’
Α 94. fercula. We may render this word ‘courses ;' it means properly
trays fitted on to the top of the table, which was let down after each
course bya trop-door and refilled. septem. Augustus (Suet. Vit. Aug.
74) contented himself with three; when he had guests he sometimes
allowed himself six: ‘he devours seven courses, and all alone! Cf.
line 140 ‘Quanta est gula quae sibi totos Ponit apros, animal propter
convivia natum?

95. sportula. The ‘dole bashet' was a ‘survival’ of the old times,
when the patron would treat his clients to a ‘coena recta;' it wasa
basket filled with cold meat and such viands, distributed at the early
morning salutatio by the ‘servus nomenclatorz' this was afterwards

ν changed into a fixed allowance of money.

96. togatae is explained by the necessity of appearing at the cere·
mony in the toga. It was hot and uncomfortable ,and ill-suited for
such a scramble. At the same time the word is ironical. Rome’s
citizens in their proud garb of citizenship let themselves down to this
abasement.

97. ille, the master. ⁴

100. ipsos Troiugenas. The very blue blood of Troy: the older
Roman families claimed desccnt from the Trojans, as the gens Iulia
