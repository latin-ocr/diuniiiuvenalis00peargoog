22 INTRODUCTION.

on the night ol their birth shall abide by them all their days.
Juvenal almost reproduces this legend when he tells us how
‘mischievous fortune stands by night smiling on the naked
babes;’ and transforms the beggars’ brats into the heirs ol 1
great houses. (Satire vi. 605.) So again in the seventh Satire
he tells us that the stars which receive the new-bom babe
determine whether he shall be a consul or a rhetorician. In
the ninth Satire there is the same vein of thought: ‘it is the
states that govem men¹.' We seem to detect in these despon-
*s dent utterances the man buffeted about hythe different chances '
os life, and perpetually deprived of the prize he thought his due.
The latalist, however, as the Turks have abundantly proved, is
not necessarily a weak man, paralyzed by the reflection that it is
idle to struggle against the stars. Juvenal insists in two pas-
sages, that is you are wise, you will have no patron among the
gods whose special protection you invoke‚ and that Fortune is ·
a divinity of our own making. Our lives are decreed before-
, hand, but the merciful gods have ordered them as was really
best, and all we need is health and a stout heart, and an even
temper that is not ruffled by missortune and that does not blench
. at the approach of death.

Thus far Juvenal was a Roman, and he was a Roman also in
his hatred of foreign divinities He detested those of Asia and
Egypt; he evidently looked upon those of Greece as mere
literary creations There is a scoff when he speaks of En·
nosigaeus bound by Xerxes or of Vulcan black from the
forge. Very different is his tone when he alludes to swear-
ing by the altar of Ceres (xiv 219), to whom he himself
dedicateda chapel‚ or describes the naked effigy of Mars with
spear and shield, and bairging from the soldier’s helmet above
the doomed enemy of Rome (xi. 108). There is not a trace
of scepticism when he speaks of the sacrifice he is about to offer
to Juno and Minerva and Jupiter. When he mentions Egeria}
whose story Quintilian had declared (Instit. ii. 4) to be sair
debateable matter, as there was plenty to say for or against it,
Juvenal contrasts the old worship to its advantage with the
present aspect ot' the grove haunted by Jews. ‘Who‚' he asks,
‘would have dared once to laugh at Numa’s sacrificial bowl?
