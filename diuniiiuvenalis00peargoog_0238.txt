SATIRE X. NOTES, ll. 1-4.

even at the follies of his times, how much more would he have laughed
at me fussy pomp of Roman gamesl

54-113. Great power entailsgreat envy: the idol of one day is the
scape-goat of the next: think of Sejanus: would you change with him,
or prefer to live a humble potentate in a country town unknown but
unenvied lo Think os Crassus too and Pompeius and Caesar: how many
tyrants die a natural death?

133-187. The spoils of war and symbols of conquest are deemed
the highest good: none care for virtue if you take away its rewards,
and yet consider the career of Hannibal. He defied Nature and had his
hand on Rome. How much does he weigh now? Alexander, who
chased at the narrow bounds of a single world, has to be content with
a sarcophagus: Xerxes’ host was so numerous that it drank up the
rivers for breakfast, and yet its commander returned disgraced, ina
single ship.

188-288. Length of years is ever prayed for: buta long life brings
sorrows oi its own: our powers decay‚ our features grow repulsive, our
friends and relations die. Nestor lived but to moum Antilochus: Peleus
to mourn Achilles; Priam to see Troy the prey of fire and sword;
Hecuba to die a dog's death : look also at Mithridates, Croesus, Marius,
and Pompeius. '

2892345. Beauty again, much sought, proves but ahane to its possessor ;
think of Lucretia, Virginia; virtue itself could not save Bellerophon or
Hippolytus, and think of Silius aud his terrible fate.

346-365. The gods should be left to choose what is for your good:
pray for a sound mind in a sound body, and a courageous heart, which
scorns death and luxury alike: this you can procure for yourself.

1. Gadibus. ‘From Gades to Ganges,' etc, from furthest west to
furthest east ; a proverbial expression, as we see from Cicero, De Domo
sua 30.

usque, ‘as far as,' used without ‘ad,’ asin Cicero, In Pis ᾗ 51
‘usque Romam? ¹

2. Auroram et Gangen must be taken closely together. Cf. the
German use of Morgenland for the East.

3. illis multum diversa. A litotes, ‘ffieir greatest contrasts,’ i. e.
the greatest evil. ‘Diversus’ is used with a dative in Hor. Ep. i. 18. 5.
‘Multum’ is one of many words found in Latin to intensify me mean·
ing of a simple adjective. It is common in Plautus, but not in Terence.
Offler such words are ‘vald ‚⁹ ‘vehementer,' ‘admodum’ ‘adfatim'
etc. Adjectives signifying ‘dfference from' are more commonly fol-
lowed by a preposition in the classical poets; other such words are
‘discors' used by Ovid, and in ecclesiastical Latin we find ‘ingratus'
used in the same way. See Handbuch der k. A. W. p. 276.

4. erroris nebula. Taken from Plato Alc. ii. 150 τὴν ἀχλὺν τῆς
ψυχῆς, who himself refers to Homer, . v. 127 seq, where Athena
removes the mist from the eyes of Diomedes.
