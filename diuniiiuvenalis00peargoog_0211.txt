and poses as such: he connts on your pride preventtng you from
attempting to borrow of a fellow·poet; but he will extend you such
contemptuous patrouage as lending you a dirty old halland a claque for
your recitatious‚ ll. 36-47. And yet we persevere, ploughing the barren
sandi You can't give up the longing to write: ‘tis an ingrained 33·
healthy malady which ages even as you age. But an inspired poet is
only made by 33 easy and cheerful mind. Horace had supped when
he cried out Euhoe! A genius must not have ever to be thinking of
buying a blanket. Had Vergil been without 3 slave arrd 3 decent roos
to his house, the snakes would have fallen from his Fury's head: her
trumpet would fail to thrill us: aud yet we ask that our poor poet
should rise to the height of the buskin 01 the old time, when his master-
piece is produced at the expense of his dishes and cloak! The proud
aristocrat Numitor, has, poor fellow‚ not the means to aid his friend in
need; though he has plenty to keep 3 mistress and 3 tame lion: but
then a lion, of course, eats less than a poet l Lucanus had wealth aud
may be content with fame, but what is farne to poor Serranus and
Saleiusl Poor Statius is the darling of the town ; he brings down the '
benches with applause, but after ali has to starve if Paris will not buy
his play. Yes, Paris is the mani He can give away even military posts.
Your actors who play popular parts can make praefects aud captainsl
But pity your poet who has to write the parts for these to play. There
are no great patrons now: none to reward the pale cheek and the stu-
dent's fast, 11. 48-97.

But is your historiari better paid? He is half ruined by the paper
alone, and yet he would get more if he were to read out the public
chronicles‚ 11. 98-104.

Lawyers get just as little for all their fuss and 311 their lies. Τ133 13·
comes of a hundred lawyers about equal the harvest reaped by a single
driver in the circus. After all your roaring and all your arguments before
3 clowu as iudex, you may receive 3 flitch 01 bacon, or some onions,
or poor wine. Say you get even 33 aureus, the attomey gets his share
ofthat. An Aemilius< gets the full fee allowed by the law, because he
is rich. Nay, it pays to hire fine clothes and rings to plead in, for
lavish Rome is most lavish to those that have. You must go to the
provinces to practise if you set 3 high value 03 your tongue, ll. 105-149.

Do you teach rhetoric? Yon must have nerves of iron to sit aud hear
your class murdering tyrants in cadencel ’Tis the same today, to»
morrow and the next day; ’tis the monotony that kills. They all want
to leam, but none want to pay, and when you demand the fee, they ¹
plead that they have learnt nothing. ‘Oh, of course the teacher is in
fault, because the boy is a dullard; I can hear his “ Hannibal ” even
now! Ask any sum youplease and I’ll pay it down if only the boy's
father may have to hear what 1 have had to hear and as often! So say
