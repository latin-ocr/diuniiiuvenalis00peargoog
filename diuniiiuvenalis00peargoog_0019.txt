12 INTRODUCTION.

be the author os the sixteen Satires that pass under his name, he
was alive a little after A.D. 127, as he speaks in the fifteenth Satire
of ‘things that were done lately when Juncus was consul,' and
Juncus-anAemiliusJuncus,asBurghesihasproved—wasconsul
in 127 ¹. Assuming him again, as is probable‚ to be the Juvenal
addressed by Martia] in three epigrams, he was grown up, ‘and
Ι of such literary eminence that he could be called ‘facundus ξ’
“fluensss or ‘eloquens’ in 93. An attempt has been made to
fix his birth in the year 60 or 67, on the supposition that the
words ‘Fonteio consule natus,' Satire xiii, refer to himself; but
the more natural construction oi the passage-it may almost be
said, the only natural construction—makes them relate to his
friend Calvinus. If we take the tradition that Juvenal attained the
age of 80, and assume that he did not live beyond the year Α.Ι). 128,
the date os his birth would be about AJ). 48, which would agree
tolerably well with the facts of his history. F or practica] purposes

» it is sufficient to observe that what we know of him as a man does

not take us back beyond Titus at furthest, or below Hadrian.
Juvenal is said by all his biographers to have been the sun or the
adopted son osa wealthy freedman. He seems to have been
brought up at a good school⁸. He is believed to have practised
declamation till he was of middle age, though rather as men of sor-
tune are sometimes called to the bar in England‚ for the sake uf
anoccupation,than to make moneyby it. The inscription at Aqui-
num shows that he served the most important magistracy in his
native town, and held the honourable position os titular chaplain‚
so to speak, to Vespasian. We know that when the first college
or chapter of flamens to a dead Emperor was instituted, Tiberius,
Drusus, Germanicus, aud Claudius were enrolled as members,

¹ Mr. Iewis and Dean Merivale prefer the reading Junius. Junius
was consul in 119, which would throw back the fifteenth Satire to about
120.

²Prof. Nettleship rightly remarks that ‘facundus’ may be used of
style, as iu Mart. xii. 43 and Statius, Silvae i. 4. 28. Thus Martial would
seem to have been acquainted with Juvenal as a writer, aud the two
poets may have shown their writings to each other.

’ 'Satire i. l. 15. Compare Pliny‘s letter (iv. 13), showing that a

town in Tuscany might be so poorly provided with teachers that the Ἰ
children of the townspeople had to be sent to Milan.
