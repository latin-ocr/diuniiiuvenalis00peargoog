SATIRE XII. NOTES, ll. 1-3.

children, and there is consequently uo good in courting him save ior his
own friendship.

Iam celebratiug this day, Corvinus, with greater honour to Ceres,
Minerva, and Jupiter thau if it were my birthday, with the sacrifice oi
two white lambs aud a young steer, sor Catullus has escaped with lise
beyond expectation3 ll. 1-16. The storm was such as poets love to de·
scribe; the ship struck by lightning, as well as in danger of foundering ’
undera black sky. Hear aud pity, though such incidents are told
everywhere in certain tablets in the temples of Isis; ll.17⁴29. The
storm was so violent that the master os the ship began to throw his cargo
overheard, and Catullus sacrificed his purple robes and silver plate,
goblets and dishes3 ll. 30-47. Couceive a man having the courage to
prefer his lise to his propertyl ll. 48—51. Last of all the mast had to be
cut away. Go to sea now, if you will, when hutchets may be as neces·
sary as provisions3 tl. 52-61. Then, when the storm ceased, they had
to rig up a jury-mast and use clothes for sails, as only the soresail was
leit; ll. 62-69. As the suu came out they discovered the heights
Alba, and presently passed between the moles os Ostia into the saie
anchorage, where sailors who have escaped the storm cau talk over the
perils ol the sea; ll. 69-82. ”

Go now, boys, and build up the altars ol green turi. Iwill go home,
where the thiu effigies of my ancestors are garlanded, to burn frank-
incense and scatter all the colours oi the iris. The very door is
wreathed with boughs and gay with lamps3 ll. 83—92.

Nor are these airs of sriendship mercenary. Catullus has three children.
How many persons would waste a siok hen on so barren a friend! ll. 93-
. 97. Even a father does not merit a quail. But let childless Gallitta or
Pacius have a touch of sever, and the temples are covered with votive
tablets, and men will be souud to promise a hecatomb os oxen in deiault
of elephauts, 11.97-110; though were the elephant found iu Italy he
would be sacrificed3 ll. 111 -114. Why, such an one would offer up a
slave or even a daughter, and not unwisely, ior if the sick man recover,

he will alter his will to the benefit ol so devoted a friend. An estate is .

more than an equivalent for an Iphigenia; ll. 115·1²7·
Long may Pacuvius live; estated and rich; unloving and unloved;
ll. 128-130.
