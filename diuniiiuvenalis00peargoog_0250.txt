NOTES, ll. 249-329.

cum graviter aegrotaret Neapoli melius est sactum. Coronati Neapo-
litani fuerunt, nimirum etiam Puteolani, volgo ex oppidis publice
gratulabantur. ·Utrum igitur, si tum esset extinctus, a bonis rebus an a
malis discessissetl Certe a miseris.’ This Was in the year 50 lac.

· 287. Lentulus and Cethegus, accomplices os Catiline, were strangled
in prison. Dio, xxxvii. 40, says that ‘Catiline'shead was cut off and sent
to Rome’ Mutilation was dreaded‚ lest the marks should be retained in a
future state: just as the Hindoos feared being blown off frorn guns
much more than being shot.

289-345. Some pray sor personal beauty, but the dangers of this are
numerous and obvious. Cf. Montaigne, ‘The Story of Spurina?

²9¹· ‘Even to whimsical fancies in her praycrs.' Seneca, De Benef.
v. 1 ‘Usque in delicias amamus,' i.e. ‘the gods are gracious enough to
hearlren to our very caprices?

292. pulchra, a reminiscence of Vergil, Aen. i. 502 ‘Latonae taci-
tum pertemptant gaudia pectus ;’ itself a copy ol Homer, Odyssey vi.
γέγηθε δέ τε φρένα Λητώ.

295. suam, i.e. ‘faciem’

297. habere miseros is ‘to keep in a state os anxiety; ' it differs from
‘afficere dolore‚' which simply means to ‘vex’ or ‘grieve ;' see Naeg.

· Latein. Stil. § 110.r quoted by Weidner. Pliny, Ep. iii. 3. 4, complains

about a youth of haudsome exterior ‘cui in hoclubrico aetatis non prae·
ceptor modo sed custos etiam rectorque quaerendus est!

306. fiducia, ‘hardih00d,‘ ‘brezenlacedness’

313. Ares was surprised by Hephaestos and caught in a net,
Homer, Od. viii. 266 sqq.; Mars is a planet too. Juvenal's thought is
thus, ‘ the youth, who himself is subject to the influence ol a planet, will
nothe more fortunate than Mars, who has his own planet! Another
reading is ‘quascunque maritis iratis debet'

325. Hippolytus, son of Theseus, was tempted by his stepmother
Phaedra, daughter os Minos. and on rejecting her advances was accused
by her to Theseus and slain: the *myth has been often treated, as by
Euripides, in the Hippolytus3 Schiller in his Phadra3 by Racine, etc.
The grave propositum is expressed in Schiller’s words (Phadra ii. 5)

‘Hz‘ppolya Was hdr* ich, Gdtterl Wiel Vergiss‘est du,

Dass Theseus dein Gemahl, dass er mein Vaterl' etc.
Bellerophon was accused on similar grounds by Stheneboea, wife of
Proetus. Cf. Horace, Od. iii. 7.

326. The reading heo is now generally received for ‘haec’ which
would grammatically refer to Stheneboea, while it must refer to Phaedra.
hae goes with ‘repulsa ‘at this rebuff' their anrour propre was hurt.

327. excanduit, ‘ glowed with wrath,' ‘fell into a white hest from
passion!

³28· concussere, ‘roused themselves to wrath ς’ cs. Verg. Aen. vii.
338 ‘secundum concute pectus) The metaphor seems to be from
waking a sleeper.

329· pudor is the ‘shame’ attendant on detection; ‘conscionsness.'
