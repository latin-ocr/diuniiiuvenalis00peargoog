SATIRE VII.

124. ‘An aemilius, a man of family and wealth, will get the full
fee’

quantum licet is explained by Tac. Ann. xi. 5. The scandal

allowed them to take ten sestertia or 100 aurei.

(Ma or). η

12y5. enim, Ἀγ, for he has triumphal effigies of chariots in his
court-yard‚ and a statue of himself taking aim with one eye shut? Cf.
Mart. ix. 68. 5. The vestibulum is explained in Becker's Gallus, p.
2 38, to be a vacant space towards the street and before the house, and
enclosed on three sides by the middle main building where the ‘ianua'
was, and by the two wings projecting into the street. Rich s. v. gives
an illustration from an ancient Roman sresco painting. The word comes

upon the truth.

134. stlattaria, from the root ‘ star,’ ‘to stretch‚’ found in ordp-ovpr
and ‘stema' Hence stlata,‘ a wide ship :’ so that the meaning seems to
be ‘imported’ Others, as Weidner, following Heinrich, take it to mean
‘tricky,’ ‘enticing,¹ because the ship, a pirate, ‘variis ludificationibus
