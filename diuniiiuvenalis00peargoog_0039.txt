masters touch he interweaves a line or a word that recalls a ι
Roman classic ¹. More often still he gives us a line or two of
heroic warmth‚ or calls up an idyll os country life, as isto show
that he was poet as well as satirist Habitually‚ however, he
was careless os language for its own sake and of the prettinesses
:of language. lt is his thought that makes his style and that
determined his choice of a subject. lt was his supreme merit
to understand that the Aeneid-itself the result of learning and
reflection rather than a poem of natural growth-was an experi-
ment that could not be reproduced. Not caring to turn out
literary rococo‚ and wishing to speak directly to the great world,
he decided to talk of what the great world really cared about 3
the last scandali, the state of the times, the decay of the patrician
order. He had to find the secret of attracting and keeping
crowds together, in his vigour, his pungency‚ and in the skill with
which he called up thoughts that it would have been dangerous
to utter aloud, or that appealed tp a vein of latent scepticism.
Take the fifth Satire. lt is imitated from Horace, and on the
whole a dull one, but it is easy to note the places at which a
tremour would have run through the listening crowd : the allusion
to the wine which Thrasea and Helvidius used to drink gar·
landed ; the comparison of the mushroom to that by which Clau-
dius was poisoned ; the mocking simile of Auster drying his wet
wings in his dungeoncave. Take again those often misunder-
stood lines of the first Satire, where the poet asks, ‘whence are
we to get back our fathers’ old simplicity‚ whose name I do not
dare to pronounce 3³ Is it difficult to understand how men just
emancipated from a despotism would thrill as the word indi·
cated by ‘simplicitas ’—the word which it had been dangerous

to pronounce‚-‘ libertas ²—rose instinctively to every lip?

The danger of the rhetorical style is that in the hands of an
· inferior artist it becomes overloaded with ornament and excludes
⁸ simplicity. The orator is alarmed lest he should seem to be
putting cloth of gold upon cloth of frieze‚ and falls into the more
dangerous error of stringing together a collection of purple

patches. A great public speaker avoids this by making 'his ’

¹ See for instance Satire vii. ll. 58, 62, and 66, referred by Mr. lewis,
1 think rightly, to passages in Ovid, Horace, and Vergil.
