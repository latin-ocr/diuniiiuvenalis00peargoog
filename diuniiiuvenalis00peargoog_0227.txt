SA Τ IRE VIII.

Drusus had a daughter Liuilla, who married Tiberius’ son Drusus. Her
daughter Julia married Rubellius Blandus (Tac. Ann. vi. 27). Their son
was Rubellius Plautus, who was murdered by Nero's orders in Asia.
Some editors, against the MSS. authority, read ‘ Plaute' here; and as
Plautus was dead long before this Satire was written, assume that he is
spoken of as the type osa class, and that he is thus addressed and
spoken of as if living. But it seems more natural to suppose that the
Blandus here spoken of was a grandson os Rubellius Blandus and bore
his name. That Plautus had children is expressly stated by Tacitus,
Ann. xiv. 59. This will place the date of his life under the Flavian
dynasty, and make him a contemporary of Juvenal's. Who Blandus’
mother, the wife of Plautus, was, is a difficult question. Tacitus (Ann.
xiii. 19) tells us that Agrippina, Nero's mother, was suspected of in·
tending to marry Plautus, and by his aid to usurp the reins of govem-
ment. Hence it is possible that the young Blandus sprang from the
illicit connection between his father and Agrippina.
