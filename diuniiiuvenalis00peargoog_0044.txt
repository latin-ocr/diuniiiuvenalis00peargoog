but that it was before Jupiter got his beard: what is this but
a classical anticipation of

‘They did not know everything down in Judeel’

Because Juvenal had the Puritan fibre and lived in a world of his
own, where morality was the only real existence, he could afford
to jest with his own creed in a spirit of confident saith.

Those who have thoroughly apprehended that Juvenal only
employed literary art to enhance moral teaching‚ will understand
one of his worst defects‚ that he is apt to repeat himself. In the
eighth Satire, to take a single instance, there is an attack on the
patrician who loves horsetiesh, which seems expanded from the
’ first Satire; an attack on Gracchus which had been more vigor-
ously given in the second3 and a parallel between Cicero and

’ Catilina, which was afterwards worked up for second use in the

tenth Satire. lt may be the fault of a manuscript that the same
lines are sometimes used more than once, as in the famous
instance of the apostrophe to Fortune (x. 3 5 5,6 ; xiv. 315, 316);
but it cannot well be accident, when the same thought reappearS,
as in the case §f the unequal penalties meted out to sin in
this world (xi. 176, 8; xiii. 104, 5), or where the poet declares
that the catalogue of a lady’s adulteries is too long to be told
(x. 2203 xiv. 26-28). lf Juvenal had cared only for perfection
’ of form, it can scarcely be doubted that he would have avoided
this recurrence of thoughts and illustrations. Gracchus cannot
have been the only noble who disgraced himself ; and there
were of course other instances of patrician vice and plebeian
virtue besides Catilina and Cicero. What the poet was really
concemed with, however, was not the form of his teaching but
its essence, and he was indifferent to iteration if one particular
example happened to be the best of its kind. The same reason
explains Juvenal’s comparative deficiency in humour. With his
keen perception of foibles and ready sense of the ridiculous, it
might seem that he ought to have rivalled Horace, but even in
the fourth Satire,·where the subject is purely comic, Juvenal’s
grimearnest gets the better of him. The picture of the
trembling Counsellors ol State, called in to deliberate how a
turbot shall be cooked, is made so sombre that instead of laughing
