the Republic, the custom os maintaining slaves in larger num·
bers increased from several causes The first of these was the
disappearance of the yeomanry, and the division of Italy into
large estates on which slaves were preferably employed as
workmen, owing to their sreedom from military service ¹, and to
the disinclination of sree mento work with them. The second

The price given for these slaves was sometimes enormous.
An ordinary field-labourer was worth about sixty pounds; those
who had any protensions to skilled labour fetched somewhat
more. A boy is mentioned by Martial who ‘setched 100,ooo
