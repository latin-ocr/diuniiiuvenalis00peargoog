and that the rest were chosen by lot out of the first families
in Rome (Tacitus, Annals i. 54). As Domitian was very careful
to maintain the dignity of the Flavian line, it would seem that
Juvenal's social position was good, or he would not have been
admitted to this office. Later on we find him praefect or tribune
of the cohort of the Dalmatians. This co'hort of infantry was
stationed in Britain during the times of Trajan and Hadrian,
and there are traditions, one of which states that Juvenal was
made praefect against the Scotch by ‘the tyrant,' while another
represents Trajan as banishing him to Scotland. The difficulties
of understanding all this are enormous. Properly ten years’ ser-
vice in the ranks was required before a man could be tribune or
praefect. It is true this was sometimes set aside in favour of
men of position; but Juvenal, in the form in which the story has
come down to us, had offended one of the Emperors byan allusion
to a favourite actor, and-was not therefore a manto be picked out
for special distinction. Theo, again, he must have been a man
of a certain age, forty if not fifty, at the time of his honorary
bauishment. Nevertheless there is some incidental evidence
that Juvenal was connected with the army, and may have been
in Britain. In the third Satire he complains obliquely of the
smallness of a tribune’s pay. In the first (1. 58) and seventh “

(l. 92) he declaims against promotion by favour. In the four· ⁸

teenth he scoffs at the rewards of military service. ‘Destroy,’ '

he says, ‘the huts of the Moors or the forts of the Brigantes,
that you may get the rank of ensign with better pay when you
are sixty.’ When we remember that in Ab. 103 the fourth cohort
of the Dalmatians was stationed among those very Brigantes,
the coincidence is at least remarkable, and it looks as if the poet
were calling to mind his own unrequited service, or that of some
obscurer comrade. Finally the allusions to the British whale, to
British lawyers, and to the short night in Britain, are a little'
more precise than we should expect from one who had neverbeen

’ in the country. The best solution of the difficulty would seem to

be if we could suppose that Juvenal, finding civil advancement
out of the question, transferred himself to the army when he was
no longer quite a young man, expecting by favour to be ex-
empted from the aunoyance of service abroad, and that when he
allowed his unruly pen to transgress, he was punished by being
