SATIRE I.

the nobility retrench the extravagance of dole-giving to paupers, who
as often as not cheat them? 11. 87-126. Meantime, while the old
dependents of his house steal away sadly‚ the patrician, recruited by
a day of diversified occupatiou, lies down in his empty hall to a splendid
banquet at which he is the only guest, and where he will perhaps gorge
till he dies, ll. 127-146.

The Satire now reverts to conversation. Juvenal asks whether he
may not launch out searlessly since we have reached a climax to which
coming ages can add nothing new in insamy. ‘True,‘ he admits, ‘ γοα
may ask where I get the talent to handle such material.¹ ‘Iask,‘ says
the friend, 'where you get the leave to talk about it? All very well
to attack a private person, but touch the Emperor’s favourite, and you
will be burned ior a Christian and an incendiary.' ‘What, arn I to
look on quietly while the man who has poisoned three unclesstares
down on me from his littcrl’ ‘If you so much as show that γοα know
him, you will be suspected of talking about his crime. It you want to
be saie, write like Vergil about dead heroes, not like Lucilius about
living men.¹ ‘So be it; Iwill confine my criticisms to those who are
already in the grave,’ ll. 147-171.

The date oithe first portion of this Satire may be referred with some
positiveness to the early years oi Trajan ογ the allusions to reciters aud
to Marius. By the bitterness of the allusion to promotions by favour in
the army it would seem that Juvenal was still or had quite lately been
a soldier. The second portion, ll. 81-146, has more of the didactic
and religious character about it; and seems to belong to the time when
’ Juvenal‘s hopes from wealthy patrons were exhausterl.

The opening part of this Satire has been imitated ογ Byrou in the
beginning oi English Bards and Scotch Revlewers. This is one ol the
Satires which Dryden translated.

Anoousur.

When I am condemned to hear so much pedantry 1 feel that 1 must ‘⁸

have my revenge ; and that revenge must consist in paying out my adver·
saries in their own coin, i. e. by writing. The writer of the present age
must pertorce be a satirist, thanks to our social system under which
upstarts are the princes of society and criminals regarded with respect,
and their crimes are regarded as merely venal. Τοε danger is great, I
admit: but the attempt must be made to attack it: and it 1 do not dare¹
to attack the living, I will at least show up the actions of the dead.

1. auditor. A mere hearer at recitations, which were made the
sashion at Rome by Asinius Pollio. Authors recited their new composi·
tions in public or in private, cf. Hor. Sati. 10. 38. As political
interest faded‚ an affectation oi literary interest came into fashion.
The younger Pliny, Epi. 13, refers to these recitations with approval,
‘toto mense Aprili nullus fere dies quo non recitaret aliquis,’ etc.
