speaks as if the two heroes had alike been purified before being admitted
into heaven ; the one by water, the other by frte. Weidner quotes

’ ‘illic sanctus eris, cum te, venerande, Numici ’

Unda deum caelo miserit Indigetem.’
64-76. The dishes of the simple meal.
64. fereula. Ironically applied to the simple dishes.
65. ¹Tiburtino. It would seem that Juvenal had afarm in the
, ‘Tiburtinus ager? See the Introduction to this Satire. The whole
description of this meal should be compared with Martial x. 48.

70. The ‘vilica’ had improvised a basket out of wisps of hay in which
to bring the eggs fresh from the nest. Cf. Mart. iii. 47. The eggs are
large, as laid by well-fed fowls.

72. ije. ‘half the year ;’ for we find, from verse 193, that the meal
was in April. Lewis points out that at the period when Juvenal wrote
the ablative was commonly used to express duration of time. The
ablative of time is a natural extensiou of the ablative of place. Such
expressions as ‘hieme' ‘aestate’ etc.. are natural after expressions like
‘acie constiterunt.¹ .

73. Pears from Signia in Latium are mentioned as healthy by Celsus
i. 24. Syrian pears grew luxuriantly at Tarentum. For the variety
of fruits on which the Romans prided themselves see Varro, R. R. i. ao
‘Nunc arboribus consita Italia est ut tota pomarium videatur.’ Cf. also
Lucretius v. 1376. For the whole question of the introduction of
foreign fruits into Italy see Hehn, Kulturpflanzen und Hausthiere.

74. Cf. Hor. Sat. ii. 4. 70 ‘Picenis cedunt pomis Tiburtia succo!

Captivi 485 ‘Abeo ab illis postquam video sic me ludificarier!

77. iam. ‘Already luxurious as compared with the fare'of Μ’. Curius
Dentatus?

77-119. Simplicity of the good old Roman times.

80. ‘A dirty slave fetched from the ergastulum would not touch them
nowadays if he could get his tripe.’

For fossor cf. Pers. v. 122 ‘cum sis cetera fossor;’ also Ovid,
Trist. iv. 1. 53 Tib. ii. 6. 25 ; Colum. i.8. 16 ‘Ergastulum mancipia

vincta compedibus! Cf. also Sat. viii. 180. For the punishment of ·

slaves cf. Becker's Gallus p. 221.

82. rara. ‘On a rack with wide bars‚‘ so that it should not get
musty. ‘Rarus' means ‘with spaces between.'

83. moris erat. Genitive of quality, or adjectival genitive. The
oldest form of the phrase seems to occur in cases like Caes. Bell. Gall.
iv. 5 (quoted by Hardy) ‘est hoc Gallicae consuetudinis.'

84. natalicium. Only on birthdays, when a feast was made to the
‘genius' and then the only extravagance was bacon. '
