147. claudius was poisoned by Agrippina with a ‘boletus medicatus'
Tac. Ann. xii. 6. Cf. Mart. i. 21 ‘Quid dignum tanto tibi ventre
gulaque precabor? Boletum qualem Claudius edit edas?

150. Here seems to be a double anteum for the words might mean
‘whose very scent is as good as a feast‚' and ‘whose scent is all you
are likely to get,' though in that case tu would have been naturally
added.

152. sororibus Afris, the Hesperides. He sneers at the Greek
tradition by calling its subject ‘the negro sistens?

153. ‘Yon enjoy a rotten apple such as the Praetorian soldiers given
monkey which they have dressed up to look like a comrade? The
‘agger' seems to be the Servian wall extending from the ‘Porta Collina'
to the ‘Porta Esquilina.' Behind this, between the Porta Viminalis and
Esquilina, lay the Praetorian camp, and the soldiers amused themselves
by dressing up a monkey in a helmet and arming him with a shield and
setting him on a goat and teaching him to throw a spear. Some
have interpreted the qni tegitur to mean a raw recruit who learns
his drill srom a serjeant contemptuously dubbed capella. But the
interpretation here given seems the most probable, and the objec-
tion which has been taken to it that ab equo iaculari is not Latin,
and that ‘ex capella’ would be used instead of ‘a capella‚' is met by
the two quotations given by Lewis and others: Prop. iii. 11. 13 ‘Ausa
ferox ab equo quondam oppugnare sagittis Maeotis Danaum Penthesilea

humorous. ·

163. quis enim. ‘Who, is he were bom wealthy or even decently off, ·
could be so utterly destitute as to put up with Virro twicet’ Pliny,
N. H. xxxi. 1, tells us that a son who had killed an enemy ‘in praetextae
annis’ was presented with a ‘ bulla aurea τ’ ‘ unde mos bullae duravit,
ut eorum qui equo meruissent filii insigne id haberent, ceteri lomm'

The nodus is a leather strap to which the signum, the so-called
‘bulla scortea,’ was fastened.

169. stricto. ‘Your bread is ready for action, like a drawn sword?

171. ‘Yon will one day come down to play the part os aregular
“ stupidus’' on the stage.' The stupid fellow who was knocked about
was one ο1 the standing characters of Roman comedy. He was repre·
sented as closely shaved. Cf. Amob. vii. 33 (quoted by Weidner). The
parasite was a special recipient of such knocks. Cf. Plaut. Captivi Ι.
