SATIREI. ’ ’

08, Ηο has a special light ring for summer3 and he shakes hie hand in
the wind to cool this; at the same time the motion serves to make his
ring flash in the sun. Martial speaks of the heaviness of the rings worn
by some Romans, xi. 37 ‘Annulus iste tuus fuerat modo cruribus
aptus: Non eadem digitis pondera conveniunt.'

30. Satura, said by the grammarians to have originally signified a
ι1101011 potch' of different ingrediente served up together; and the
original form is said to have been ‘lanx satura ;' this will answer 1ο the
‘farrago' or ‘medley‘ (i. e. of pictures of contemporary society) which
Juvenal expressly declares his worls 10 be. ‘Per saturam ’ is used in
the meaning ‘all in one mass? See the note 00 ‘Satura’ Ι,

iniquae, ‘unfair,’ because admitting such inequalities.

31. tam ferreus, i. e. case-hardened.

33. The palanquin is filled by himself, though there was roem for
two, as we leam from Suet. Nero 9. Weidner supposes that under the de·
nomination of ‘delator’ the M. Aquilius Regulus is meant who is spoken
of by Pliny, Ep. i. 5. 14, and in iv. 2. 4, in terms which would suit this
passage. On the ‘delatores ' see Tac. Hist. iv. 42· These ‘delatores,'
like the F rench mourbards under the second Empire, were amongst the
' ‘instrumentaimperii.' On Tiberius¹ encouragement of the ‘delatores’ ’
000 Merivale, Hist. of the Roman Empire v. 265, and on M. Aquilius
Regulus see voi. vii. 387.

34. 11 was the policy of the Empire to suppress the nobility. They
were successively persecuted by Tiberius, Nero, and Domitian, especially
the 1001. Cf. Sat. iv. 85 sq.

The expression rapturus quod superest de nobilitate semesa
reminds us 01 ‘Nil habuit Codrus, quis ¹enim negat; et tamen illud
Perdidit infelix totum nihil' Sat. iii. 208.

35. Massa, in 70 mn, Procurator 01 Africa: a notorious ‘delator'
Cf. Tac. Hist. iv. 50. Martial speaks 01 him, xii. 29, as ‘fur nummorum?
Herennius Senecio and Pliny accused him ‘repetundarum' after his
proconsulate 10 Βο01100, and he was condemned.

36. Mettius 00100 was another informer equally notorious, who
procured the condemnation 01 Herennius Senecio in 73 mn. Cf. Plin.
Ep. i. 5. 3.

44. Beer alleges that the reading 01 P. is Lugudunensem, andwe have
therefore adopted it into the text. He gives many instanees 01 1110-
word occurring in the form ‘Lugudunum' on coins and in inscriptions,
e. g. Cohen, Deser. Hist. des Monnaies Imp. i. 51. 4, and Dio Cassius,
xlvi. 50, who expressly speaks of the town as Λουγούδουνον μὲν ὀνομασθέν,
νῦν δὲ Λούγδουνον καλούμενον. Α 1011οὲ00110 01οἀοΙ1100 found in Orange
represents the genius of Lugudunum with sceptre and comucopia, at
its feet sits a raven on a rocla, see Froehner, Les Musees de Franee
pl. xv. n. 0, and p. 59 f. These birds are supposed to have been the
symbols 01 the Celtic God Lugus (ans'wering 1ο the Roman Mercurius),
gen. Lugovas (Irish Lug, gen. Loga); thus Lirgirdunon will= ‘ Lugu’s
festivals? This etymology was proposed by Arbeia de Jubaiuville
