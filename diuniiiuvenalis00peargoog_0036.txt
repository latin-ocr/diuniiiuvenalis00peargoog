more than outweighing the genuine affection and respect
evidently felt for Vergil, and the casual eulogies of Quintilian,
Lucan, and Statius. It is probably to be imputed to a defective
taste‚ that the men whomJuvenal singles out in this way for praise
are declamatoryand florid and given to false antithesis, and that
he never glaucesoff to admire the stately conciseness and nervous
strength of Tacitus, or the epigrammatic form of his own friend
Martial. It is difficult also to resist the impression that Juvenal
was halfashamed of literature ; and that while he conceded the
highest honours to a few of the immortals, such as Cicero and
Vergil, he inclined to regard the pursuit of letters, where it was
not justified by high geniuS, as disgraceful to a man of the highest
family. He himself,a man of the middle class, who had endured
the sea and the helmet and the spade, might without dishonour
try to push himself by reciting satires, but it was a count in the
indictment against Nero that he had written ‘Troics’ The

play; and of course on the same principle, it was a mistake to
write ‘ La Legende des Siecle5,' and Victor Hugo would have been
better employed on composing a Homeric travesty for Mdlle.

parents stingy. Meanwhile, Juvenal, who had learnt to regard
his literary life as a failure, was producing greater works than
the wealthy amateur, Lucan, or the literary mechanic‚ Statius,

profits of a rapid sale, but out of the depths of a buming indig-
nation. The man’s whole life, good and bad, is in his verse;
personal disappointment and resentment, the scom of whatever
was foul and weak, the love of whatever was lofty and brave and
Roman.

lt can scarcely be doubted that Juvenal's Satires were written
Α for recitation. We can still trace the passages in which the
poet had introduced a deft allusion and paused for applause;
those in which he had contrived a surprise, that almost loses
its point with a reader; and those in which he varied his effects
