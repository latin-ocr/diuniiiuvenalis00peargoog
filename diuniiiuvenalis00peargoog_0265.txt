SATIRE XII.

iashionable at Rome, and, like other Oriental importations, is sneered
ut by Juvenal. Meu who had escaped irom shipwreck hung up in the
temples oi their favourite goddess pictures representing the danger which
they had escaped. Cf. Hor. Odi. 5. 13 and Sat. ii. Ιι. 33. The pain·
ters got their employment thanks to Isis.

31. alternum, the waves threatened to break now one side, now the
other. ·

32· arbori. Lachmann‘s emendation sor ‘ arboris,’ which is the read·
ing of Cod. Pith. The obvious difficulty is the hiatus, which is unex-
ampled in Juvenal. Another reading puts a comma at ‘undis,' ‘arboris
interitu nullam prudentia cani Rectoris cum ferret opem.’ So Weidner.
Heinrich reads ‘marmoris incerti ;' cf. Ribbeck 60 sq.

33. decidere, ‘to compromise,’ a law term, cf. Mart. ix. 4. iactu,
sc. ‘iactura‘ ‘by throwing cargo overboard.’

39. In i. 66 he speaks of Maecenas as ‘the model lounger!

41. quarum goes closely with passm the garments are said to own
the animals that produced the wool. ‘Other garments whose producere
the virtue oi the generous herbage dyed bright, though the rare aud
mysterious efficacy of the water and the climate of the Baetis aided as
welk’ The Baetis was supposed to have the virtue of giving a tinge oi
purple to the wool which was grown on its banks; cf. Martviii. 28, etc.

43. The lancee were the argentum they were silvered over.

44. Parthenio. Unknown. Notice the dative of the agent.

45. Pholus was a centaur who was represented in different passages
as wielding a crater against the Lapithae. ef. Val. F laec. i. 337, Verg.
Georg. ii. 455, Stat. Theb. ii. 563. A passage of Stesichorus, preserved
in Athenaeus xi. 14, represents Pholus as draining a huge goblet and
handing it to Hercules.

conjuga Fusci, possibly Saufeia, mentioned Sat. ix. 117.

46. bascaudas, a Celtic word (Welsh ‘basged’), and noted as such
by Martial xiv. 99 ‘Barbara de pictis veni bascauda Britannis) lt is
here mentioned among articles of plate, and may have reference to some
articles oi plate or porcelain surrounded by basket work like the modern
Italian bottles.

47. callidus. Philip who, according to Horace, Od. iii. 16. 13,
‘auro diffidit urbium Portas vir Macedo? The story was that he bribed
Euthycrates and Lasthenes, in Β. c. 348, to let him in. Their names
must have been well known, as Demosthenes de Corona was such a
common-place in the schools of the Rhetoricians. quo probably stands
for ‘ex quo ;’ though Weidner assumes the meaning to be that he had been
able to deiray the expense of his revels by the value of his silves plate.

50-51. These lines are regarded as spurious by Bentley and Markland
and relegated to the margin by Weidner.

52. ead neo damna lavant. ‘But not even do these jettisons give
relies to the ship :' nor was it likely they would, Juvenal means.

54. reccidit=reoeoidit as ‘rettulit ' sor‘retetulit.' ‘ It came to this, ·

that he had to lower the mast by the axe, and so he gives his cramped
