NOTES, ll. 61-86.

72. per famam et populum: probablya hendiadys ‘through all the

talking mob'
efferre, the regular word for ‘to carry out a corpse for burial.’
Ci. ‘effert uxores Fabius, Chrestilla maritos' Mart. viii. 43.

73. Gyaros, or Gyara, a small barren island between Andros and
Ceos, the Botany Bay of Rome: see Tacitus, Ann. iv. 30: much used
under the empire as a place for deported criminals. The elision of the
long vowel in aude is unusual, though not unparalleled. Cs. Sat. xiv. 76.

74. si vie esee aliquid. Another reading is ‘aliquis ι’ but ‘aliquid’
seems the more pointed. Ci. Plat. Apol. 41e ἐὰν δοκῶσί τι εἶναι
μηδὲν darer: for the reading ‘aliquis 'which Lewis adopts, he appositely
quotes Theoc. xi. 79 κήγὼ τις φαίνομαι ἦμεν.

75. criminibus here means ‘crimes' commonly ‘ accusations.’ Ovid's
nse oi ‘ sine crimine coniux' marks the transition oi meaning.

hortos, such as those oi Caesar, and those oi Maecenas Mayor
has an exhaustive note on the gardens oi the rich Roman nobles.

praetoria, properly the general's tent: then an emperor‘s palace,
the princeps being the regular imperator: then the large country house
of any rich man. -

mensas. Their costly tables oi citrus wood, made oi sections of
the whole tree. See Helm, Culturpflanzen und Hausthiere p. 361.

76. ‘Their old silver plate and the goblet with the goat in high relief.'
Cf. Preller, Gr. Myth. i. 561.

79. The idea resembles thatin Dryden's ‘Religio Laici :⁹-

‘For while from sacred truth 1 do not swerve, .
Tom Sternhold's or Tom Shadwell's rhymes will serve.'

80. clarianus, some unknown second-rate poet of the day.

81. ex quo, from tlre time that, ἐξ οὗ.

The story of Deucalion is told at length by Ovid, Met. i. 260 sqq.
,, 81—146. The present condition oi society compels one even against
one's will to write Satire. Vice has never been so general or so shame-
less. We worship the goddess Money, in fact, even though we have es
yet not formally deified her.

82. navigio, climbcd the mountain in his vessel; a touch of irony, as
Mayor remarks.

sortes poposcit means ‘asked for the eracles ;' these were pieces
bi wood with verses on them, which were first shuffled and then drawn.

lt seems probable that the myth oi Deucalion and Pyrrha arose
irom a misunderstanding oi the word πύρρα, ‘ the red earth,' and a con·
fusion between λαός and λᾶας, see Max Miiller, Chips vol. ii. p. 12. ef.
Pindar,01. ix. 42 Arde alep Πῦρρα Δευκαλίων τε Παρνασοῦ καταβάντε
δόμον ἔθεντο πρῶτον, ἄτερ δ’ εὐνᾶς ὁμόδαμνον κτησάσθον λίθινον γόνον.

83. caluermrt mollia. ‘Mollia‘ is proleptio ; ‘warmed into softness!
The whole description is modelled on Ovid, Met. i.

86. discursus, their ‘restless aims,’their‘eagersussiness’to gain honour
and money; the word in this sense is peculiar to. the silver age of Lat-
inity. Cf. Sen. de Brev. Vit. 3 ‘officiosa per urbem discursatio'
