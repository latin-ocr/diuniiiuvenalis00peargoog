irum its literature and its daily press3 criticisms which go far
to create and maintain 3 sound morality‚ and to promote a
regular moral development in each nation. Each nation of
modern times, too, thinks of itseli as one of a number of
other nations, each developing ior itself its own idea of virtue

to profit by the criticism of its neighbours. In short, each
modern Capital is the repository of the best minds which mould
the destinies nithe State in which it lies. In the ancient Roman
world, on the contrary, we see one vast all-pervading power,
careless of the criticisms os any foreign country, and only from
time to time criticised by Roman satirists, or corrected and

and under which each succeeding imperator arrogated or was
assigned ever new powers and new attributes.

Slave7y.—But in comparing the state oi society of Rome with
that prevailing in modern StateS, we must never forget that
Rome was a Slave State, 3ηά we must picture to ourselves the
srightsul 3ηά degrading influence of that system upon the morals
and habits of a slave-holding nation. ln the only great example
we have had in modern times of a slave-holding State, the
influence has been but too baneful and too evident. But in
Ι the case of the Southem States of America the guli was wide
between slave and master; the slave was of a race marked by
nature as ol an intellectual level inferior to that oi those who
were wicked enough to take advantage of this weakness to
enslave ‘God's images cut in ebony.’ Similarly in convict
