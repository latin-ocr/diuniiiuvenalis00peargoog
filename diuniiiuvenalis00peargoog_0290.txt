SA'PIRE XV.
οιν Tus RELJGJON oF Εονκν.

THE subject of this Satire is a quarrel between the people of Ombos
and those of Tentyra, two towns in the Nile valley situate about
1oo miles irom one another. It appears a little strained in Juvenal
to call these two towns neighbours; but it must be remembered that
their districts would extend further than the towns, and the distance
between the two as the crow flies is less than seventv miles. It seems
from line 28, where the sceneos the sight is fixed at Kopios, that the
Ombites had made a pilgrimage to that city, and were combining

’ worship with a feast and a drunken orgie. The people ol Tentyra.

only tivelve miles distant from Koptos, thought the opportunity too
good to be lost, and sallied forth for a laction fight with the revellers.
