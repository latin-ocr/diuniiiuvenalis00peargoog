SATIRE XI. INTRODUCTION.

for he tells his guest that he may bathe when he likes without regard to
fashiou, and describes himself as waited 011 by country boys. In the list

of country towns cligible as residences which Juvenal gives in Satire iii.
five out of seven are in the way to or near Aquinum. These are Gabii,

Praeneste, Sora, Fabrateria, aud Frusino. Os the other two Tibur is the
place near which he had a farm, and only Volsinii is in quite another
direction. The chauces are that he was at this time in villeggiatura,
iu some neighbourhood like that of Praeneste‚.where he could easily get
supplies from his Tiburtine fa'rm and receive the visits of Roman friends.

The whole talk of the town is of Rutilus, who, not having measured
his gluttouy by his means, is about to turn gladiator, though his age
would fit him for the army, ll. 1-8. There are hosts of men who
live only to eat and who live better than their creditors, though the
ehinks in their shattered fortunes already let in the light. From pawn·
ing their plate and breaking up their mother’s silver bust they come
down to the arena, ll. 9-19. It is disastrous when a man does not know
who he is, what marriage he cau aspire to, whose cause he can venture
to plead, or how much he can dare to eat, ll. 19-38. For when your
belly has swallowed up investments and plate and laud and live stock‚
what remains butan old age more terrible than death? ll. 38-45. Tho
ruin begins with horrowed money3 it ends in levanting, which does not
cost a blush, and only brings regret because the absconder has to miss
the amusements of Rome, ll. 46-55.

You will find out, Persicus, when you come to dine with me to·day and
are welcomed as Hercules aud Aeneas were by Evander, whether all my
praise of simple diet is hypocrisy, ll. 56-63. Yon will get no city
carries, but a sucking kid with mountain asparagus and eggs warm
from the hay by the side of-the hens that laid them, and grapes kept
fresh for months, and apples and pears mellowed by keeping, ll. 64-76.

Such was once a splendid feast for our nobles when Curius supped off
pot—herba which a ditcher with memorias of the eating·house would
disdain, ll. 77—81. Then a chine of bacon was kept for' feast-days to
be supplemented perhaps from a sacrifice, and the err-consul or dictator
would knock off work earlyto go to it with his spade across his shoulder,
ll. 82-89. Then, when the nation’s foes and even the magistratesss col-
leagues trembled before him, it was uo matter of serious concern to get
a large tortoise-shell for a conch, but an ass’s head in bronze was the
head-piece of the bed. Food and fumiture were well matched, ll. 90—99.
Then the soldier, with no taste in art, broke up the goblets fashioned by

great craftsmen to hammer on an ornament for his horse’s trappings or
his helmet: and the spoils glittered over the foe's face, ll. roo-107.
These men whom you may be justified in envying supped off Tuscan
pottery3 but their eurthenware Jupiter watched over them, and the
