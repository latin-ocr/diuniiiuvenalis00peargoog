serve as an illustration of what is meant One is a line that
describes a short woman standing up on tip-toe to be kissed:

‘Et levis exerta consurgit ad oscula planta!

Another is a passage that describes the hurry and tumult in
a house that has taken lire:

⁴ Iani poscit aquam, iarn frivola transfert
Ucalegon, tabulata tibi iam tertia fumant?

ln a third the fate of Caius Silius seems indicated by the heavy
sall of the line:

‘Rapitur miser exstinguendus
Messalinae oculis.'

χβΜτ. Lewis¹ in a very forcible passage has pointed out that
Juvenal is of all ancient authors the most distinctly modem;

, that his pictures are like those ol Hogarth3 and that he has

often been imitated by modern writers, such as Boileau and
¹ Johnson. lt will be found that the notes ol a modern style
which belong' to Juvenal are straightforwardness, minute obser-
vation, the love of sharp contrasts, and the trick of disguising
moral earnestness, in irreligious language. Banter, humour, sly
irony are as alien to Juvenal's temperament as broad farce to
his subjects. He is trying to teach truths‚ not to paint pictures;
and il every dozen lines are rich with imagery or suggestions of
citylife and household soenes, it is because the man who walked
Rome with his beart boiling at what he saw, took in every group

profanitieS, that Juvenal is more English than Italian and more
American than English. ‘Orestes did not murder his wife and
sister, did not poison his relatives, did not write a bad poem!
Admittlng the point of view from which a Roman regarded an
exhibition of bad taste and folly in a ruler of men, there can be
no doubt that Juvenal meant to startle the imagination by the
violence of his comparison. American wit abounds in sharp
contrasts of this sort, as, sor instance, when Mr. Lowell declares
that if he happens to see a slaughterer on his way horne from
his day’s work, ‘sorthwith my imagination puts a cocked hat
upon his head and epaulettes upon his shoulders and sets him
up as a candidate for the Presideucy’ So again with Juvenal's
