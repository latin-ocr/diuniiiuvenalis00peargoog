SATIRE XIII. NOTES, ll. 174-248.

174-198. ‘Well, then, is perjury to go wholly unpunishedl Surely
Ι have a right to claim revengel' This is the doctrine of the unen·
lightened: the sage would not agree with you. Resides, Conscience is
the most sure avenger.

175. graviore catena is an ablative of the manner.

176. nostro. Juvenal implies that he would like to see the de-
faulters punished as much as Calvinus would.

178. sospes. Properly of one who has survived peril; ‘ your deposit
is wreclred und can never return, but is his body should be maimed the
little blood made to flow will give you a hatelul consolation aster all.'

180. Montaigne in his Essay on Diversion (lv) maintains the doc-
trine which Juvenal denies. ,

181. indocti. In contrast to the ‘sapientes’ or ‘enlightened,' sor
the ancients found their consolation in philosophy, and not in religion.
‘A rooted hatred, an inveterate thirst of revenge, is a sort of madneSS,
and still eddies round its savourite object’ Coleridge‚ Sibylline Leaves.

184. chrysippus, as representative of the Stoics; Thales, as repre-
sentative ol the wisdom of old times.

185. ‘Nor Socrates, sweet as the honey ol his own Hymettusf ef.
Sat. vii. 206. He was seventy at the time os his trial.

187. nollet, ‘would not wish' ‘Noluerit’ would have been ‘did
not wish’ Horace, Sat. ii. 4. 3, tallrs of Socrates as ‘Anyti reum?

191. ‘Yon may inser the trutlr ol this immediately, sor none is so prone
to revenge as a woman.¹ Cf. Seneca, De Ira (quoted by Mayor) i. 13,
‘ira muliebre maxime et puerile vitium est.'

194. mens habet attonitos. Such uses as that of ‘habere’ in this
passage prepare us lor the use os tlre auxiliary verb in the Roman lan-
guages; but ‘habere' implies the idea ol keeping in suspense. By the
time of Ulpian ‘habere' has corneto be used as a simple auxiliary: cs.
Dig. 48. 5 ‘Neque enim laborare habet.’ The whole process os the
transition of ‘ habere' into a mere auxiliary is treated by Thielmann, in
Wiilfflin's Archiv fur Lateinische Lexikographie, 1884.

197. Caedicius, some strict judge ol Juvenal's time.

199. This story is told exactly aster Herodotus vi. 86.

204. moribus, ‘principle' ’

208. Glaucus then was punished sor wishing to break his cath: how
much more surely shall punishment await him who has actually carried
out what he meditated.

210. ced Most common in eomedy, and iu the language os ordi-
nary lise. Th word is composed os ci, or ce, an old demonstrative form
seen in cis, cite etc, and dare. In Plautus and Terence we still find
the word used in* the sense os ‘give’ Cs. Phorm. v 8. 4² ‘Quin tu mi
argentum cedo. lt. Immo vero uxorem tu cedo l'

conata. Thelw‘ord is used in a passive sense. Cf. the uscos
‘venerata Ceres’ in Horace, Sat. ii. 2. 124.

220. On the power· os Conscience see Montaigne's ‘Essay on Con-

science' and the instances quoted by him os its terrible power.
