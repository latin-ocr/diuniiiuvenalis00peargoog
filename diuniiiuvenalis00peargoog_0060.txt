ROME UNDER THE EARLY EMPIRE. 53

to stand alone in its passion for the grim sport. The Emperor
to be popular must fain simulate the interest of his subjects.
Thus it appears that Claudius declined to avail himself of the
interval of repose which followed the morning performances in
the amphitheatre, but would call for a fresh supply of gladiators
tn fill up the tedious interval.

Trajan after his successful campaign on the Danube exhibited

gladiatoria] games lasting a hundred and twenty-three days, ,

and engaged 10,ooo combatants for the occasion. Domitian

the foul teachings of the stage with fatal effect.
