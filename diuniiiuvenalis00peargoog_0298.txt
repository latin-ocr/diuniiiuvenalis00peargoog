ficed; cs. Goethe's Iphigenie auf Tauris. (For the developmeuts and
different manners oftreatiug the Greek myth see England’s ‘Iphigeneia
in Tauris' Intr. prii. sqq.)

119. quis modo. ‘What sad chance, and nothing Μεθ’ Weidner
cites Cic. Tusc. v. 66 ‘Quis est omnium qui modo cum Musis habeat
aliquod commercium? ’

111. ‘Could they, in the extremity 01 drought, when the Nile would
not rise as usual, do any fouler deed to cause the Nile-god to fall into
obloquy 101 not risingl’ uolenti = ἀέκοντι ἅν, ‘si nollet.’

124. Britones. Cf. Hor. iii. 4. 33 ‘Britannos hospitibus ieros? It
is scanned in Martial xi. 11. 9 ‘Britdnis’

125. The Sarmomatee, or Sarmatae, inhabited Prussia, Poland, and
Russia. The ‘que' continues the negation uniting ‘Sauromatae' closely
to ‘Britones;’ hence ‘aut Agathyrsi' for ‘et Agathyrsi’ These were a tribe
in Transylvania spoken 01 by Verg. Aen. iv. 146 as ‘picti,’ ‘tattooed’

126. We have seen that it is 1 characteristic 01 Juvenal to avoid
mention 01 the name 01 1 uation or person by substituting for it some
’ marked peculiarities 01 those or him who bore the name: thus the ,

, Egyptians, he says, are a useless and unwarlike people; their business

is not with arms, but with the most miserable kind 01 river traffic; aud
in their wars they show aiu equally miserable and childish spirit.

127. Strabo describes the Egyptian boats os earthenware (p. 788).
Vergil, Georg. iv. 289 ‘et circum pictis vehitur sua rura phaselis‚¹ i. e.
they sail over their sarms when the Nile overtlows. Modern travellers
describe earthenware rasts as in use in Upper Egypt to the present day.
phaselus, ‘a skiff' so called because it was shnped like a French bean,
as ‘gondola' comes from κόνδυ 1 cup. Diez, Wbrterbuch p. 408.

128. incumbere. Their oars are shortqyet they have to put their
whole weight into them; their boat is a ‘testa,’ aud even that is ‘picta’

131. Suffering and the sight 01 suffering raises in these people wrath
and cruelty instead 01 fortitude aud pity.

133, Mayor quotes Pliny, N. H. vii. ξ 1 ‘flens animal ceteris impera-
turum)

For the opinion 01 the aucients as to weeping, see Lessing, Laocoon i.
‘Der Grieche schamte sich keiner der menschlichen Schwachheiteu; keine
musste ihn aber auf dem Wege nach Ehre und von Erfullung seiner
Pllicht zuriickhalten.' The Greek was ashamed 01 10 weaknesses that
are human; but uo one dare hold him back in the path to honour, nor
from the fulfilment ot his duty. The Roman soldiers shed tears, as is
told by Caesar, B. G. v. 33. See Forsyth's ‘Lise of Cicero‘ p. 533.

135. squalorem, i. e. ‘ squalorem amici causam dicentis squaloremque
rei ;’ cf. Hor. Od. iii. 1. 11 ‘Moribus hic meliorque sama’ for ‘moribus hic
melior meliorque fama' The idea 01 the accused party in a suit puttiug
01 mosming in which to appear in court is quite opposed to modern
