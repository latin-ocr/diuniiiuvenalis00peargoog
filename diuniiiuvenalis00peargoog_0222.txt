NOTES, 11. 165-204·

181. This verse is rejected by Weidner, who deems it a temnant of a
first cast os the Satire; it certainly seems somewhat awkward.

183. cenatio. ‘The dining-hall‘ adorned with ornate pillars of
Numidian marble, and turned to the north so as to catch the sun when
not too strong.

184. ‘However dear thehouse, there will be forthcoming a structor to
arrange the courses, and a pulmentarius who made the preparation of
dainty dishes his specialty.'

185. qui condit = pulmentarionrm conditor; such periphrases are
characteristic ofa rhetorical style. Lachmann conjectured condiat for
‘condit' on the analogy of ‘ebulliat’ scanned as a dissyllable by
Persius ii. 10. It seems at first sight unlikely that the indicative
should follow the subjunctive; but on the other hand, Muyor quotes
Satire xi. 130, where ‘despicit‘ follows ‘comparet’ Cf. also iii. 102,
where ‘si poscas’ follows ‘si conspexit’

187. ‘If, then, the fees paid by parents are so small, how comes lt
that Quintilian is so rich? He is a lucky man: and your lucky man
may expect anything.‘ Cf. Hor. Sat. i. 3.124. Lcwis points out that
Pliny, Ep. vi. 32, speaks of Quintiliau's moderate means; and rightly
adds, that ‘Pliny was rich and Juvenal poor ;‘ so that what seemed a
great sum to the one will have seemed but small to the other.

192. ‘Yes, your lucky man gets even made senator,’ lit. ‘has been
known to attach the crescent to his black leather boot.' The aluta was a
half-boot, so called from being steeped in alum to soften it. A small
crescent was attached to it in front, which appears to have been a
survival from the ancient‘ calceus patricius,’ dating from 300 B.c., before
which time classes were distinguished by their dress.

193. ‘And if he has a cold he sings specially well. In fact he can’t
sing without one? Possibly Juvenal had in his mind the words of
Horace, Ep. i. 1. 108 ‘Praecipue sanus nisi cum pituita molesta est,'
though the thought is different.

194. Cf. Hor. od. ii. 17. 21 ‘Utrumque nostrum incredibili modo
Consentit astrum!

197. Juvenal here refers to an occurrence which took place under
Domitian ; cl. Plin. Ep. iv. 11. 1 ‘Praetorius hic modo. . .eo decidit¹
ut exul de senatore, rhetor de oratore fieret' ¹

199. ‘What about Ventidius and Tullius? Τὴεγ are simply instances
of luck and mysterious destiny.’ Ventidius Bassus, a captive who rose
from a muleteer to be consul, Β. c. 43, Gell. xv. 4.

Tullius. Servius Tullius, the son of a slave woman.

200. sidus. The influence of the stars; potentia is also an astro·
nomical term like ‘influence;' cl. Schiller, Wallenstein’s T od, Act i.
Sc. 1. 6 ‘Ja, sie (Venus) ist jetzt in ihrer Erdennah’,Und wirkt herab
mit allem ihren St'arken?

204. Thrasymachus of Chalcedon, a younger contemporary of
Socrates, mentioned in Plato's Republic lib. 1 and 2. Of his end we
know nothing.
