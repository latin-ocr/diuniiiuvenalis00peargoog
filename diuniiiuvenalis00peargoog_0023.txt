16 INTRODUCTION.

England, and the inference would appear to be either that his
residence in Britain was very short or that it must be referred
to the early period of his life under Domitian. The intensity of
his feeling against that Emperor would be easily explained, if
Domitian really ordered him away from Rome and quartered
him in a country which above all others must have been uncon-
genial to a townsman.

This hypothesis involves the apparent difficulty that Juvenal
did something to displease Domitian, and yet did not publish the
Satires which attack the Emperor till after his death. The diffi-
cultyis not a great one. The traditional life, which is all we have
to go upon except the tablet of Aquinum, represents Juvenal as
practising declamation for a long time, and he may have given
offence by the topics treated in his declamatione. The remark
ascribed to Trajan that Juvenal owed his promotion to Philo-
mela, shows that the poet was at one time favourably noticed at
the court for his literary work-not necessarily a poem called
Philomela-and there is no difficulty in assuming that the favour
was afterwards forfeited by an indiscretion. The evidence that
the seventh Satire in its present form was addressed to Hadrian
and not to Domitian seems overwhelming, not only because it is
inconsistent with Juvenal’s general estimate of Domitian, but
because Quintilian, who took pupils for twenty years, can hardly ¹
have acquired the great wealth which Juvenal commemoratas as
early as the year 83 A.D.,when Pariswas putto death. Atthe same
time it must be borne in mind that Juvenal's Satires bear the
marks in 'many instances of having been composed piecemeal.
Often the composition is not homogeneous‚ as for instance iu the
second Satire, where an invective against the appearance of a
patrician in the amphitheatre is tacked on to a diatribe against
unnatural vice. Sometimes a favourite line is repeated or imi·
tated. More often the changes are rung upon a single simile,
till the effect is weakened instead of being intensified. It seems
probable that Juvenal was at first essentially a reader in the
Roman salons, and that he purposely constructed his poems so
as to be able to omit a passage when it would be dangerouS, and
allowed himselfa choice of illustrations which he could vary at
pleasure. Later on, when the Satires were transcribed, either
the poet could not bring himself to strike out the redundant
