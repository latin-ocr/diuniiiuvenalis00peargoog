SATIRE XIV. NOTES, ll. 278-331.

Hor. iv. 5. 10. It was the route sor the tr‘affie from Italy to Asia
Minor. Gaetulus is used simply sor ¹ African?

calpe, Gibraltar. ⁴ He will venture beyond the pillars os Hercules
into the unknown Ocean where the sun siuks iuto the sea with a hissiug
sound.' Cf. Tac. Germania 45, who speaks of the same thing occurring
‘in alio mari trans Suinas.’

281, tenso folle. ‘with crammed purse ;’ aluta is likewise a leather

urse, sostened by being steeped in alum.

. ²83. In speaking ironieally os the ‘young solks os the sea,' Juvenal is
thinking os ‘ the sight of Proteus rising srom the sea‚' and ‘Triton blow-
ing ou his wreathed horn.' For the ‘monstra’ cf. Tac. Arm. ii. 24,
who describes the soldiers telliug of the wonders witnessed during their
German expedition, ‘vim turbinum et inauditas volucres, monstra maris,
ambiguas hominum et belluarum formas)

284. Avarice is only one phase of madness. Euripides in his ‘Orestes’
ll. 266-264, gives us another, where Orestes sees in his lunacy the
F uries rushing to his destruction, and Electra, his sister, holds him in her
arms and beckons the wild figures to stand off. Juvenal seems to have
in his mind Horace, Sat. ii. 3. 50 sqq.

286, Aiax, again as depicted by Sophocles, was mad in a different
way; he was driven mad by disappointed ambition. cf. Sophocles,
Aiax 53 sq.

287. ‘Even though he refrain from tearing his clothes, the man who
will risk drowning for so little needs a keeper.'

289. distinguitur, ⁸ is parted from the wave by but a plank‘s breadth.'

291. Coins with the head ol the Emperor and his titles.

292. ‘He sets sail in quest olbis gaiu in spite os every menace os the

‚ weather; he says the lowering sky and strip of cloud are nothing; ’tis ’

mere summer thunder.’

296. fractis trabibus, ‘shivered timbers.'

297. ‘He swims with his right and tries to save his purse with his lest
hand and his teeth.’ Lukian has a similar picture, Dialog. Mort. xi. 4
τὸ δὲ χρυσίον ὀδοῦσι καὶ ὄνυξι καὶ πάσῃ μηχανῇ ε’φὺλαττον.

302. Referring to the custom alluded to in Sat. xii. 27 ; shipwrecked
mariners got the picture ol their catastrophe roughly painted and dis-
played the picture to excite pity.

303-331. ‘Comfort yoursell by reflecting on the troubles of the rich
and the very little that nature needs.'

306. Licinus. The type os a millionaire. ef. Sat. i. 109.

attonitus, ‘distractedz' The word seems in late Latin to bave 2
less strong signification than in classical Latin ; cs. Pliu. Ep. i. 22. 5 1.

307. electro, his ‘amber,' out os which drinking eups were made. cf.
Sat. v. 38.

Phrygia columns. Phrygian marble from Synnada. Pliny, N. H.
xxxv. 1, states that the ‘lapis Synnadicus' was relieved by artificially
inserted purple spots, ‘Neronis principatu inventum ut purpura distin·
gueretur Synnadicus (lapis).’
