. ROME UNDER THE EARLV EMPIRE. 57

patrons as he can get¹. To get food or a present no trouble
was spared; slaves were bribed²; adulation was freely lavished3
terms of obsequious flattery like ‘dominus’ and ‘rex' were
employed towards the patron: the highest aim of the client was

to get some post as bailiff or a bit os land ³. ’

However stingily the patron might provide sor his clients, it
could not be but that he should find the system a heavy burden
and expense, and the rich man found it cheaper to distribute a
small sum to his clients instead os the ‘cena’ The clients now
went from patron to patron and begged this small sum from
each in turn. This dole was called ‘sportula’ The word
‘sportula’ strictly speaking, is used of sacrificial occasions, on
which the ‘exta’ were appropriated to the gods: the ‘viscera’
or flesh being distributed among the guests who carried or sent
their portion horne in a basket called ‘sportula’ Sometimes,
however, they consumed their portions at a common meal called

' ‘visceratim’ in which case bread, wine, etc. had to be added to
the portion received. The same proceedings took place at
‘epula publica,’ public meals given by a magistrate, or by the
Emperor, or indeed by a private individual, to large masses oi
the people. At these entertainments guests were either pro-
vided with a regular meal (cena recta), or each guest received
his own portion in a basket provided for the purpose. Thus
Caesar entertained the entire male population of Rome in the
year 46 Β. e. at twenty-two thousand ‘triclinia' The entertainer,
on such occasions, contracted with a caterer (‘ manceps’), paying
him for each place, or for each ‘sportula,' a specified sum. The
proceeding was then simplified by paying the sum direct to the
guest. In the case os ‘ cenae rectae’ the entertainer was sup-
posed to provide handsome ‘lecti' and ‘ vasa,’ and was thought
stingy if he failed to do so; so that Nero effected a public
economy when he abolished entirely ‘cenae rectae,’ and main-
tained the ‘sportulae’ alone.

The clients who had attended their patron all day received
either their portion of food to take horne with thern, or a sum
of money (one hundred quadrantes, Juv. i. 120), Martial
expressly tells us that he gave up his patron in disgust‚ finding
