ΜΕ oF JUVENAL. . 39

Boileau with less real power and even less literary art, was
paraphrasing some of the best Satires, the third, the sixth‚ and
the eighth. By cutting up the third into two (1 and 6) and
separating the description of the corruptions of town life from
that of its discomforts‚ Boileau throws into strong and exag-
gerated relies the trivial scenes which in Juvenal serve as a soil
to the intensity of moral declamation. lt is however in the imita-
tion of the eighth (Sat. v.) that Boileau's weakness is best seen.
Boileau tells us in fourteen tedious lines (57 sqq.) that were you
the descendant of Hercules and withal a man of no account, the
ancestral honours are ‘mere chimaeras ;’ ‘ I see nothing in you
but a coward, an impostor, a trahor, a villain, a deceiver, a liar,
a fool whose fits resemble madness‚ and a rotten branch of a
very illustrious trunk.' Bathos can hardly go further, and the
general feebleness is not redeemed even by the comparative
vigour of one couplet:

‘Et tout ce grand eolat de leur gloire temie
Ne sert pius que de jour a votre ignominie?
Juvenal is better than Boileau athis best in the parallel

passage:Incipit ipsorum eontra te stare parentum
Nobilitas claramque facem praeferre pudendis?

But above all Juvenal’s fertility is conspicuous. He does not
amass epithets, but he multiplies pictures of patrician degene-
racy‚ and calls up vivid illustrations of what the real nobles had
been b'y whom the greatness of Rome grew. Even where

Boileau is at his happiest he never rises 10 the nervous energy
oi his model.

‘Je ne puis rien nommer, si ce n'est parson nom ;
J’appelle un chat un chat, et Rolet un fripon' (Sat. i. 51)

is wittier but scarcely so powerful as the

‘Quid Romae faciam? mentiri nescio,‘

fromwhich it is expanded. Where Boileau has the advantage
is in dealing with the lighter and more sportive aspects of
1 human weakness. To Juvenal it was sufficiently comic, that the
learned lady should weigh Homer and Vergil in the balance ¹.
