relates how he was trained not to care for the sports of gladia·
tors‚ may serve to show what the best Romans felt upon this
matter. Orestes slayinghis mother was the interpreter of the
old laws of the blood-feud, and the gods themselves dared not
condemn him. Nero, when he slew Agrippina, had at least the
extenuating causes of fear for his own life, and passionate
revulsion against his mother’s rule3 but Nero, garlanded and
anointed, strumming a harp on the public stage before Greeks
and Syriam, was wantonly degrading the gods of a great patri-

Even in times nearour own the profession of a player has been
regarded as infamous by men who reflected the feelings of
patrician society, and whose intellect might be supposed to raise
them above its prejudices. ‘A gentleman,’ says Montesquieu in

Horace Walpole could not regard these appearances as a crime,
but he felt them to be a grave impropriety, which of itself dis-

¹he abhorred the affectation of speaking Greek and the craze
V for Greek accomplishments‚ which ¹were overspreading Roman
society. Cicero had many years before remarked that a patriot

a F renchman,' is anticipated in the vigorous lines of the sixth
Satire; ‘she will ask for everything in Greek, though it is far
