ΟΝ ROMAN SATURA.

THE word Satura has been traced to different origins. The
commonly accepted account of it is that given by the gram·
marian Diomedes, viz. that it is connected with the‘lanx satura,’
a dish filled with numerous and diverse firstfruits of the earth
and offered to the gods As alternative'possible derivations he
gives a kind of sausage or. forced meat (⁴ genus quoddam farci-
minis ') which he alleges that Varro called ‘satura’ Others, he
sayS, derived it from ‘lex satura:' a bill passed as we should
say ‘in globo‚' the different clauses not being considered one by
one but altogether. These three derivationS, it will beobserved,
all assume that the meaning of ‘a medley’ is prominent in the
word as used by Varro and as understood by Diomedes, Pro·
sessor Nettleship compares with the form of the word that of
feminine substantives formed from adjectiveS, such as ‘noxia,’
a fault, ‘dira,' a curse, and others. It seems not improbable that
the original form of the expression may have been ‘fabula
satura,’ just as the original form of the name of many of Plautus'
plays was ‘fabula ’ with an adjective attached, such as Mostellaria,
Asinaria, etc, sc. fabula.

Livy, in the passage quoted below, ascribes the origin of
dramatic performances at Rome to players who were sum-
moned thither from Etruria and danced to the music of the
‘tibicen' The young men of Rome adopted the example of the
imported artists, and added an irregular dialogue to the dance.
Their perfonnance is said by Livy to have consisted of ‘impletae
. modis1 saturae,’ and he contrasts this with the irregular dialogue
in verse, resembling but not identical with the Fescennine verse
which preceded it. ‘Satura,’ then, seems to be the name which
Livy gives to the dialogue when set to music and regular rhythm,
after the introduction of the new art hythe histriones.

Livius Andronicus next, we are told, gave up Saturae and
gave a connected play with a regular plot ².
