There remains Ribbeck’s theory that the more general and
impersonal ofJuvenal’s SatireS, the tenth, twelfth,thirteenth‚four·
teenth, and fifteenth, with perhaps the sixteenth, and with parts of
the fourth and eleventh‚ were not Juvenal’s‚ but were the work of
an imitator. Conceming this it may be said that while it would
⁸ strike out two of the weakest, the fifteenth and sixteenth, it would
also take awayfromJuvenal the tenth andthirteenthSatireS, which
are among his most finished and best. There is nothing in Roman
literature of the poet's time, in Persius and Martial, in Lucan
or StatiuS, that approaches the level of these for vigour or poetic
feeling. Therefore, as Mr. Lewis has pointed out, we have the
“ difficulty of being compelled to find a place sor a poet who was
only second to Juvenal, yet who was content to let his best work

pass under Juvenal’s name, and whom his contemporaries never ’

detected in his forgeries Let it be granted that it was easy for
a sorger to imitate Juvenal's style and to dovetail expressions that
had been carefully parodied intoa didactic poem. Was it equally
easy to affect Juvenal’s whole tone of thought so that there should
not appear the least incongruity between the teaching of the
true andos the salse Satires? Mr.Lewis's suggestion that the
declamatory Satires were the work os Juvenal‘s youth, and were
‘touched up and added to and published along with his Satires
when he had become famous through the latter,’ is os very
different critical value, though it can only be treated, in the
present state of our knowledge, as mere conjecture. Certainly
a man trained to declamation might naturally break ground on
themes of such a general kind as were treated in the schools

On the other hand, Satire xiii seems to be referable to a really ’

late date, and it is perhaps natural to suppose that Juvenal, as
he advanced in years and lived> at a distance from Rome, was
less and less personal in his treatment of society, more and more
wary how he offended great men. The offence given to Hadrian
at the close ol his life may have been foravery fancilul cause. The
crime for which Apollodorus was put to death was nothing worse
than a criticism on some shrines for sitting goddesses, which he
said had been built so low that if the goddesses rose they would
carry off the roofs. Lastly, when we remember that Romans
