SATIRE IV.

Ο
libras ponderis raro admodum exsuperant? Horace, Sat. ii. 2. 33,
ridicules the idea that fish tasted better because they were large.

16. sano. ‘To be sure he gave a sesterce for every pound, as those
say who on big subjects talk still bigger!

18. ‘I congratulate the sly fellow on his trick, if he gave so handsome
a present to get himself made heir-in-chief to an old gentlemau.’

19. praecipuus in the writers os the Silver age for the more usual
‘ primus’ or ‘ maximus)

20. ‘He had afurther eud iu view if he gavea present toaladyin
high station (who might aid him afterwards to rise higher).’

21. antro, ‘a palanquin' covered so as to ensure her privacy, but
with large windows so as to eusure, at the same time, that she could
keep her eyes open.

23. ‘We have lived to see many extravagances committed in com-
parison with which those of A'picius seem miserly and sparing.' Seneca,
Ep. xcv. 42, relates that Apicius bid against P. Octavius, praesect ol
Egypt, for a mullet: but desisted on finding that the latter bid 5000
sesterces for the dainty. See also Mart. iii. 22.

24. succinctus=‘ alte cinctus' Horace, Sat. ii. 8. 10, giving a picture
not merely os a slave, but of a slave hard at work. ‘The reed apron ol
your country tucked up for work!

2 5. squamam, of course for a fish; but the satirist picks out the
most useless part to signify the whole.

26. provincia. ‘In the provinces you cau purchase an estate for the
price: nay, in Apulia a really large one.’ Weidner aptly quotes Ovid,
Met. viii. 283, to illustrate this use ol aad ε ‘Misit aprum quanto maiores
herbida tauros Non habet Epiros sed habent Sicula arva'minores ;’ and
Apuleius uses ‘sed' as a mere resumptive, ‘totum me, sed prorsum
totum recepit’ (Met. x. 22). Apulia was a dry, patched-up province,
thinly inhabited. Cf. Seneca, Ep. lxxxvii. 6 ‘tantum suburbani agri
possidet quantum in desertis Apuliae possideret?

28. putamus. ‘What must we think?’ Cf. Cic. Tusc. Disp. i. 2ο
‘quodtandem spectaculum fore putamus Γ Cl. also Catull. i. 1‘Cui douo
lepidum novum libellum l‘ Cf. also ‘in qua te quaero proseucha l’ Sat.
iii. 296.

29. induperatorem The archaic form points the irony, as it also
suits the metre.

31. scurra, ‘the private jester' of the Emperor ; satirically sor his
boon companion.

32· During the first century of'the empire the emperor would often
promote his favourites to the rank of ‘eques' by presenting them with
the goldeu ring. See Pliu. N. H. xxxiii, 3²· ’

33. ‘He would buy up sprats, his fellow townsmen (implying that

they were about as valuable as he), which he had bought from a parcel '
of damaged goods.' Others understand fracta da merce ‘on a parcel
being broken up,' as Crispinus was too poor to buy a parcel whole·

sale.
