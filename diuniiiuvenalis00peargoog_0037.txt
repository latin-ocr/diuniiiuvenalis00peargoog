for different audiences by a choice of illustrations, any one of
which could be dovetailed into the main structure of the poem.
There were several ways in which a poet might recite. He
might try to collect a crowd in a temple, or some other place of
public resort, or he might get the loan of a room from a wealthy
patron, or he might wait to be asked at a private party. The
contempt with which Juvenal alludes to the public reciter, the
bitterness with which he speaks ¹of dependence upon a patron
for the mere use of a hall, are slight reasons sor supposing that
he addressed select audiences, invited probably by circular, and
meeting under a roof. There is evidence that recitations were

p very frequent in Rome, and that the necessity of attending them
was felt to be agrave social infliction. Pliny, who mentions on
one occasion that there had been public readings every day in
the month of April, lets us know that a great many hearers
went reluctantly and did not stay out the reading, and apolo-
gises on another occasion for going himself, on the ground that
he was r'epaying a friend for attentions of the same kind.
Pliny, however, records also that during a time of political
liberty, probably under Nerva or Trajan, recitations became
popular, and men were found to recite three days running, and
could get audiences to listen to them, not, he remarkS, because
there is more eloquence than there used to be, but because it is
possible to write with greater freedom, and so with greater
pleasure to oneself. Juvenal's Satires-teeming with allusions
that would be caught up in a moment, and breathing the spirit
of aristocratic feeling as it lingered in the best sets-are pre·
cisely the kind of literature that would be fashionable in such
breathing-times as Pliny describes.

a subtle allusion or comprehended a deep thought more fully ; the
hearer is justly impatient if he loses the thread of an argument
and cannot recoverit. Juvenal's very style is direct. When he
is not making positive statements‚ every point of which may be
concluded in two or three lines, he is either ejaculating or asking
questions. Lest a point should be missed he repeats it, and
accumulates illustration upon illustration. Like almost every Ι
