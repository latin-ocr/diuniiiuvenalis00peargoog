SATIRE IV. NOTES, ll.138-154.

138. ‘A fresh, unnatural appetite procured by drinking! Others take
aliam famem to mean ‘and other unreal appetites produced by emetics.'

141. The best oysters were those from Circeii: ‘his neque dulciora
nequetenerioraesseulla compertum est’Pliny,N.H.xxxii.6.21(§§6o,62).
Next ranked the Lucrine, and last those from Rutupiae, Richborough.

143. ‘He could actually tell whence came an echinus without tasting
it at all.’ The sea-urchin was much prized as an article 01 (1111; cf.
Hor. Sat. ii. 4. 30.

145. dux magnus. The Emperor really was defeated by these
tribes, but held a triumph none the less. Cf. Tac. Agricola 39 ‘F al·
sum e Germania triumphum egit emptis p'er commercia quorum habitus
11 crines in captivorum speciem formarentur!

149. pinna seems to bea technical term referring 10 ‘pinnatae
literae,' in which bad news was announced, whereas good news was
borne by 1 messenger with a spear bound with myrtle. Simcox quotes
Statius, Silv. v. 1. 92, 93 ‘Omnia narn laetas pila attollentia frondes
Nullaque famosa signatur lancea pinna? y

153. ‘The handieraftsmen ;' just as we use the word ¹snob,' which
properly means a bootmalrer’s apprentice. We have followed Mayor in
priuting 1111 word with a capital letter, implying that it is used generi-
cally as a proper name denoting a class, much as we speak of‘ Hodge
and Dick? Cf. Juvenal’s previous use of Titius and Seius, iv. 13.

154. L. Aelius Lamia was put to death by Domitian: cf. Suet. 10.
Horace addresses two Odes to him, viz. i. 26 and iii. 17, and this seems
to be another of the numerous passages iu which Juvenal has had Horace's
lines running in his mind: ef. De Iuvenale Horatii imitatore, by·
Schwartz, where the whole subject is fully treated.

SA'HRE V.
ΟΝ NJGGARDLr ΡΑ T RONS AND THEIR PARASITES.

Trrnrn is nothing to determine the date of this Satire, but from the
style, which more distinctly recalls Horace, Satires lib. ii. 8, than any
other of Juvenal's, and from the care with which allusione to Domitian
are excluded‚ and examples of oppression or stupidity chosen from the
times of Nero and Claudius, there is a slight probability that itis one'
01 the poet’s earliest, and was composed while Domitian was alive.

The Satire is an outburst of indignation against the professional diuers
out and hangerson of the wealthy at'Rome, who could condescend to
sell their wit and sinlr their sels-respect for a good dinner. We have a
good description of such parasites in Plautus, Captivi iiii. 1, andin
a fragment preserved to us of Eupolis, in which the chorus of Κόλακες
describe their policy; aud specimens of their wit, such as it was, are pre-

¹ served to us in Horace, Satires i. 5. 51-69, where Sarmentus and Cicirnrs
banter each other in a way which we can hardly deem witty. This
