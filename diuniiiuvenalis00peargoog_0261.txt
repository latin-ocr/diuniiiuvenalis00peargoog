TO COR VINUS, ΟΝ CATULLUS‘ ESCAPE EROM
SHIPWRECK.

ΤΗΕ only passage in this Satire from which its date can be conjectured
is the allusion, in ll. 75-82‚ to the security of the port of Ostia, which
probably refers to the improvement of that harbour by Trajan. The
precise date of the enlargement of Ostia is unknown, but Pliny describes
Trajan as ‘parens aedificandi' in the Panegyris 51, which refers to the
early part of the reign. The parenthesis about the elephant, ll. 101-110,
is in Juvenal's worst style. The last eight lines seem dragged in for·
cibly, and have no meritos their own to plead as an excuse. On the
other hand, the passages describing how Corvinus will be welcomed,
ll. ¹-9 and 83-92‚ but especially the latter, are very charming.

The ‘viola' l. 90, is generally translated as ‘violet’ or 'wall-flower.’
Mr. Lewis adds the pansy and the harebell, Mr. Mayor the stock. 1t
seems to have been applied to a great many flowers, into the colouring of

which‘viola’ enters, and not tohave been confined to springflowers. The
‘iris‘ would best meet the requirement of many colours. See, however,
Hehn, p. 210.

Ben Jonson{ in his ‘Volpone or the Fox,' has many reminiscences of '

Juvenal. The comedy is an exceedingly well constructed play upon the
artifices of‘ captatores) and the malicious glee of the old milliouaire
who gulls and baffles them. The Argument rs appended: -

‘Volpone‚ childless, rich, feigns sick, despairs,

Offers his state to hopes of several heirs3

Lies languishing; his parasite receives

Presents of all, assures, deludes; then weaves

Other cross plots, which ope themselves, are told.

New tricks for safety‘ are sought; they thrive: when bold,

Each tempts the other again, and all are sold.'

Annuwnwv.

Juvenal’s friend Catullus having been saved from imminent danger
when menaced by a shipwreck‚ the poet writes to inform Corvinus that
he intends to celebrate a sacrifice in honour of his friend's return. Not
that he has anything to gain by doing so, he adds; his friend has three
