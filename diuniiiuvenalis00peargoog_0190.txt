255. 2211211111. Quintilian, viii. 3. 21, tells 111 that ‘sarracum’ was
the ‘sordidum nomeu' for ‘plaustrum.'- Juvenal, in v. 23, character-
istically uses the ‘sordidum nomen’ iu speaking of the constellation 01
‘the Wain.’ The fact that he uses the word altera will show that he
regarded‘ sarracum ’and‘ plaustrum’ assynonyms.

256. populo minentur—Nam ‘They threaten death I say—sor
should the waggon turn over? v

building purposes Cf. Μ211. v 22. 8

260. ‘Their body perishes entirely and becomes as invisible as their

261. bucca, the Low Lat tm word for‘ month,' commonly used' 1n a

flask?

264. While the family are expecting him horne to dinner‚ the master

the while (iam) is sitting 011 the bank 01 the Styx and shuddering at ·

the grim ferryman.’ He speaks scoffingly, as usual, of Greek mythology.
A small eoin was put into the mouth of Greek corpses, as ναῦλον, 10 get
