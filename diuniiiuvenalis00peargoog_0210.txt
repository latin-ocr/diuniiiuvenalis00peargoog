ΟΝ THE MISERI' OF AUTHORS.

Tms Satire is descriptive of the miserable state 01 authors in Juvenal’s
time. Friedlinder, in his Sitteugeschichte iii. 413, points ou't that
there seems to be a want of connection between the Introduction (1-2'1)
and the body 01 the poem. In the Introduction we are told that hope
. has arisen for the poets since Caesar took them under his patronage.
The Satire speaks of the influence of the great patrous 01 1011015, the
Maecenases, etc. as past and gone. Again the Satire speaks of meu of
letters in all brancbes; 1110 Introduction of poets only. Hence as Trajan
did encourage rhetoricians and professore, while Hadrian was a poet

himself and a poct's patron, he infers that the Introduction was an ’

afterthought and added by Juvenal under Hadrian’s reign. The other

and more probable alternat-ive is to assume that the Caesar referred to
is Trajan, who is spoken 01 by Pliny (Paneg. 47) as having given breath
aud blood and fatherland 10 studies. Professor Ne'ttlesbip believes that
1110 Caesar referred to is Domitian, who seems spasmodically to have
patronised literary men z and it is certainly true that many of the allu-
sions in the rest of the Satire, such as those to Statius, Quintilian, and

even Palaemon, fall into his reign. Domitian died in 81, Nerva in 96,
and Trajan in 117 An). and was succeeded by Hadrian.

The hopes aud possibilities of our studies lie in Caesar alone. None
buthe has cared 10 cheer the Latin muses when real poets have had to
turn bath-keepers, 11011015, 00011000015. 11 you cannot get your bread
by writiug, you must needs come down 10 such trades as these; thir is

better than swearing to falsehoods, as is the way of our new aristocracy,
ll. 1-16.

But 11115 sad state is past and gone. Poets may take heart, their
prince is secking ont the worffiy3 to seek other patron were lost time ;

our rich men praise learning, as children admire peacocks: ’tis their
fancy: meantime the age for action and usefnl work is passing by, and
a poct's old age is sad aud hungry, 11. 17-35. .

The man you call your patron thinks he is a far better poet than yon
