highest order of the poetry of society,’ able to bear ‘the

same definition as the best conversation-good sense and witin s
equal proportions.' No one would speak of Juvenal’s Satires as
the poetry of society. Whatever their success in Roman salons
may have been, it must have been due to the fact that their
¹ terrible directuess of purpose and austere morality were con·
genial to the revival of saith and earnestness for which the
period between Domitian and Marcus Aurelius is memorable.
Bitter as Juvenal’s epigrammatic touches are, we feel throughout
that he wishes to gibbet the sin rather than the man. Even
where he pauses to trifle with his subject, his sportis never the
dallianee of a man of the world, impressed with the humorous

side of a baseness or crime. lt is the grim'eamest of the *J

lashed, before a heavier scourge descends upon what is wicked.
Why Juvenal should have chosen verse as the appropriate
vehicle of his thoughts may seem at first a little difficult to
explain. M. N isard has expressed an opinion that Juvenal's real
position in literature is that of a declaimer3 and that his style
represents a constant struggle between the energetic conciseness
natural to himself and the diffuseness taught in the schools of
rhetoric. We have seen from the scanty records of Juvenal’s
life that he declaimed in the schools till he was nearly of
middle age3 and no one can doubt that his style everywhere
recals the orator. The lavish use of illustration, the frequent
introduction of dialogue, the fervid straightforwardness of words,
are all congenial to the best practice of the orator. N evertheless
the very tenus of M. Nisard's criticism suggest a doubt as
to its thoroughness. We have in Juvenal a consummate master
of style, who has been trained for twenty years as a rhetorician,
and who wields a language that was at least as perfect for
prose as for verse. All at once this man deliberately chooses
verse as the vehicle of his thoughts, and creates unmistakeable
master-pieces, transcending his own rude models, Lucilius
Varro, ay and even Horace, and influencing modern litera-
ture in its best period. Can anyone seriously think that Juvenal
would have left his mark in this way, if he had written prose
declamations? Would he have achieved higher success than
Seneca or Boethius? fs it not the case, that like every great
