SATIRE XIII.

1-22. ‘Evil deeds are punished by conscience, Calvinus, even though
a wicked judge may fail to punish them. This may be one consolation
to you. Another is that what has happened to you has happened to
many, and you can atsord it. Do not iret3 it is unmanly. The teuch-
ings oi philosophy are good3 but even common sense without philosophy
might teach you to bear such a loss as this!

1. exemplum, ‘precedent‘ ‘Exemplum' (from ‘eximere ¹) signifies
strictly ‘what stands out exceptionally in a series os events.' and thus
‘exemplum malum'will be ‘a precedent' or outstandin example os
barm. In prose we should have expected ‘ in exemplum maglnm’ ‘so as
to bea bad example.'

2. displicetin the Silver ag'e signifies more than merely ‘displeases 3'
‘gives pain to.' Cf. Sen. Epp. 4² ‘nec ulla maior poena nequitiae eat
quam quod sibi ac suis displicet' (quoted by Lewis).

3. ‘However much unrighteous iufluence may have carried the day
against justice in the cheating um os the presiding magistrate? The
praetor presided in criminal cases, and may have tampered with one of
the urus in which the votes of the ‘ iudices’ were deposited.

5. quid sentire. ‘You must surely believe that all men are agreed
in condemuing such a scandal as robbiug you os your deposit.‘

7. The technicnl sense os ‘ iactura‘ as ‘jettisou' thrown out to lighten

a labouriug ship has disappeared‚ and the word means nothing more
than ‘a losS,’ as in Vergil's ‘facilis iactura sepulcri! Else the metaphor

would be extremely confused. As it is it seems to be taken from an
overweighted swimmer.

ro. medio acervo. From the centre os fortune's heap os chance
occurrences: taken at haphazard.

15. viscera are the larger organs of the body; we may translate
‘aglow with seething heart! Cf. Seu.0ed.358‘visceraspumant.' The
philosophy is that of Hor. Ep. i. 6, v. 16, 17.

16. stupet, ‘is he amazed at thisl'

17. The first question which arises is to whom do the words ‘stupet
haec' refert They seem to referto Calvinus, and the sense is ‘can
a man like you who are over sixty be bewildered at such a thingl’
and line 18 means ‘or does the manisold experienee oi lise serve to
teach you no better lesson l‘ Some commentators make ‘stupet’ refer to
Juvenal, in which case ‘Fonteio consule uatus' would fix approximately
his age, as it would that of the Satire, if we were only sure which
Fonteius was intended. One C. Fonteius Capito was consul in an. 59,
C. Vipstanus Apronianus being his senior collengue. Iu the year
67 there was a Fonteius Capito who was put to death in Lower Ger·
many at Galba's suggestion. It seems probable that this is the Fonteius
here mentioned, as the name os the senior consul, as was tbe Fonteius
in question (Tac. Hist. i. 7), was employed to fix dates. This would
fix the date os this Satire at 127 Α. n, the tenth year of Hadrian's
reign.

19. magna, with ‘sapientia' ‘Great is indeed philosophy: she cau
