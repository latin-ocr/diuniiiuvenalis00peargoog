PREFACE. 7

aclever but hypercritical and too ingenious work3 Iuvenalis
Saturae, erkl'art von Andreas Weidner (Triibner, 1873), an Ι
excellent edition 3 Juvenal, with literal English Prose trans-
lation and noteS, by John Delaware Lewis ; Professor
Mayor’s Thirteen Satires of Juvenal, with English notes:
replete with erudition, but too full for a School edition;

(Macmillan, 1873) 3 Simcox's edition, in the Catena Classico· ·

· rum, 1873 (Rivingtons)‚ a work containing much that is
fresh and suggestive, but much that seems over-refinement
in criticism 3 Hardys school edition (Macmillan, 1883).

Among modern criticisms of Juvenal as awriter should be
mentioned the Essay in Nisard's ‘Poe‘tes romains dela
Decadence! Many valuable dissertations on particular points
of Juvenal literature have appeared in different German
Reviews. Of these we have found useful-‘ Quaestiones Iuve-
nalianae,' by Schbnaich (Halle, 1883); ‘De Iuvenale Horatii
imitatore,’ by Schwartz (Halle,1882); ‘Iuvenal ein Sitten-
1ichter seiner Zeit‚' by Dr. Ρ. Doetsch (Leipzig, 1874); and
‘De locis aliquot Iuvenalis explicandis,' by Schmidt, 1851.
Others are, Vahlen's ‘Vindiciae Iuvenales' (Berlin, 1884),
and Palen ‘de Iuv. SatiriS,’ 1882.

Professor Nettleship’s Essay on the Roman Satura is most
instructive. ’ ·

In the text the editors have mostly followed that of Otto
Jahn, as adopted by May013 though they have in places
punctuated differently from him: they have, however, cor-
rected this text by the fresh collation of the Pithoean MS. as
described by R. Beer in his ‘Spicilegium Juvenalianum,'
Leipzig, 1885.

'Ihe text has been expurgated so that it may safely be
perused by the mixed classes in our modern English
Colleges.
