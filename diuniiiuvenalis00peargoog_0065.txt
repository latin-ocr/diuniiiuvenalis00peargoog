Famz'ly Life—While public morality was thus undermined
by the wholesale sapping of independence of character, a simi-
lar process os deterioration was proceeding in the case of family
lile. The good old Roman virtue of chastity was falling daily
more into disrepute. The Roman wife and Roman maiden
had been expected to vie with the vestal virgins in purity of life.
‘But since the Civil Wars marriage was looked upon as a mere
temporary contract to be set aside when its ties became burden-
some to either party. Contemporary writers speak of divorces
without surprise as of quite ordinary events. This heedlessness
of the sanctity of marriage is remarked on with indignation by s
Juvenal (vi. 224). At the same time a disinclination for marriage

, manifested itself all over Italy; the result of which was the
decrease os genuine Italians throughout the country, and their
replacement by hordes of foreigners, mongreIS‚ slaves, and freed-
men. To remedy this evil Augustus introduced his laws to
render marriage compulsory‚ the so called Iuliae Rogationes;
viz. the lex Iulia sumptuaria, the lex Iulia de adulteriis et de
pudicitia, the lex Iulia de maritandis ordinibus, and finally, the
lex Papia Poppaea (Α. D. 9), which imposed certain disabili·
ties upon unmarried persons os both sexes of marriageable
age. The result of Augustus’ legislation was unfortunately‚
on the whole, unsatisfactory. Men, finding that they had
better make the best of a bad case, reconciled themselves to
marriage, but did their best to gild the bitter pill by courting
heiresses under wius, while women imposed on themselves
the distastesul setters of matrimony, in order to secure an easier
field sor their evil proclivities. The laws which Augustus con-
scientiously passed against vice merely seem to have increascd
it, and it is difficult to portray in words the depth of degradation
to which morality had sunk in Rome by the time of the beginning
os the Empire. The most potent clement in the regeneration
of Rome in this dark time was the emigration thither of good
familias from its colonies, municipia, and provinces¹3 and it is
instructive to find a provincial like Juvenal pouring out the

vials of his indignation against the vices of the Capital.
