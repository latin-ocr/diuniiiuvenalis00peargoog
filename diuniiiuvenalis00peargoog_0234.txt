we must either suppose that Juvenal is for the moment speaking of
Damasippus as having volunteered as a gladiator; or else that heis
speaking of his moral death, which Weidner prefers. Ι prefer the
former interpretation. ’
vendant. As Julius Caesar compelled the eques Dec. Laberius tu
appear on the stage, Macrob. Sat. ii. 7. 2. We learn from Suet. Nero 12
that Nero compelled many senators and knights to fight in the arena.

195. gladios, simply for ‘death‚¹ as in ‘Antoni gladios potuit con-
temnere‘ Some have thought of the meaning of the ‘profession of
gladiator,' but the context seems inconsistent with this.

196. quid for ‘utrum' is a mark of late Latinity, sometimes found in
prose.

197. ‘Has any one ever fallen so low as to prefer to be the “mari
soupconneux” of Thymele (i. 36), or the mate of Corinthus, the stage-
blockheadi’ The characters of the new comedy, as is well known,
were standing characters, as the ‘currens servus,' the ‘parasitus edax,‘
etc.; the stupidus seems to have been another of these: cf. an inscription
of Orelli's, Inscr. Lat. 2645 found at Verona (cited by Weidner),
‘Aurelius Eutychei, stupidus gregis urbanae)

198. citharoedo, as Nero was.

199. ‘There is only oue lower depth: the gladiator’s school? Weidner
would read ‘ludius,' aud scau it as a dissyllable 3 but this seems un·
necessary.

aoo. Your nobleman disgraces his order by not even disguising
himself as a ‘mirmillo' whose features were concealed by a helmet:
buthe appears as the ‘retiarius' who had to try and fling his net over his
adversary, and transfix him with his trident. Should his attack fail, he
had to run away. Thus the Roman noble twice disgraces himself, (1)
by displaying his face, when for very shame he should hide.it; (a) by
assuming a rdle whichentailed his running away.

201. The Gracchus whom hementions appears here, as before, as a
priest of Mars, decked in his priestly costume of the Salii: cf. Livy
r. 20.

202. He scoms them; and acts on his feeling of scom: it is no mere
affectation.

203. He appears asa ‘retiarius' for which see Rich s. v.

²05· spectacula, ‘the places of the spectators,' for ‘ the spectators‘
themselves; just as ‘servitia' stands for ‘the slaves)

207. ‘We must believe the testimony 0f his priestly tunic (the ‘tunica
picta’ of the Salii), which, picked out with gold, stretehes from his neck
dowuwards; and the gold ribbons flutter from his long conical cap.'
The word aurea must be taken with both tunica and spira. ‘Spirae’ is
the name of the two ties by which the bonnet of the Salian priests was ,
fastened under the chin. He has donned a costume resembling that of
the Salii, which at once attracts attention and challenges inquiry as to
the wearer.

’ 208. galerus is the regular word for the tall bonnet of the priests
