20 INTRODUCTION.

satirist, he is even further removed from the orator than from
the poet, and has no affinities whatever with the declaimer of
schools?

Quintilian has toldus in an instructive passage, that there is¹
practically no difference between forensic oratory and declama- ·
tion. The objectos each is to prove a case. (Institutes, lib. xi.
cap. 10.) The object of the satirist is to deal with indisputable
principles, to recal or enforce truths that lie outside demonstra·
tion or doubt, and, to impress not the intellect but the moral
sense. A declamation on the excellence of chastity, on the
advantage of scorning wealth or of living up to the obligations os
a noble ancestry, would have been received with frigid acquies-
ence in any respectable· salon of Rome. Juvenal’s first object,

βε has been said, was to gibbet the vice ; but to spare the person
and expose the vice has always been a cheap exercise of virtue.
The satire, however caresully constructed, was pregnant with
banishment or death, and the man who dealt in work os this kind
carried his lise in his hands. The satirist is not properly a poet,
t'or the poet is concerned with absolute beauty3 the satirist with
*the awful contrasts of beauty and soulnesS, order and disorder.
Juvenal, though he has the poetic fire, and here and there the
p artist’s touch, stops short ol being a poet, because he cares more
for right and wrong than ior art. Nevertheless the satirist has
· this in common with the poet, that his work is best done when it
is achieved with the fewest possible strokes. The thought that
goes to the beart, the remembrance that stirs conscience, the brief
word that rings in the ear, these are the appropriate weapons of
the satirist. The rhetorician, on the other hand, has to expand
a theme, and no beauty of imagery, no play of feeling, no wealth
oi happy description, can turn a sermon into a poem. Whenever
thought ceases to be suggestive and becomes dialectical, poetry
and satire sade away. In either it is an acknowledgement of
weakness to analyse. The sense of beauty cannot be tested
with tube and crucible. The inspiration ol the Hebrew prophet
must‘flow forth unchecked like a message srom God. It is the
strength of moral passion, at once reticent and intense, saying
little because it seels much, that imposes conciseness upon the
satirist, that drew Juvenal away from the declaimer’s tribune.

This theory of course implies that Juvenal was penetrated with
