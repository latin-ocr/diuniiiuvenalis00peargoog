ΟΝ THE CODEX PITHOEANUS,
Aru> orara eruar uss, or JUVENAL.

THE chief MS. authority for Juvenal is the codex known as
the Pithoeanus, so called because it was first edited by P. Pi·
thoeus (Pithou), in an. 1575. It is sometimes called ‘Budensis,’
as it came from Ofen, where Matthias Corvinus had collected

many MSS, to Montpellier, where it is at present deposited in
the Medica Libram, ‘acore de Medecine‘ (wo. 125). Hence

it is now frequently spoken of as the ‘Codex Montepessulanus.’
This MS. has recently been collated by Beer, and is described
by him in his spicilegium luvenalianum (Leipzig, 1885). It
contains altogether 84 leaves3 the first three marked respect·
ively a, b, c, being on paper of the fifteenth or sixteenth cen-
tury; the more ancient portion (folios d, 1-79) consists of
vellum3 this more ancient portion is divided into quaternions
(layers of four sheets each). This part is thought to date from .
the ninth century. Besides Juvenal, it contains the Satires of
Persius (folios 2-13), folios 13-79 being devoted to Juvenal.
Each page contains 29 lines, and a space is left in the margin
five centimeters wide for the reception of glosses.

The glosses on the ‘manus prima' seem to have been
written by the same hand as the text.

The glosses on Persius are comparatively few3 those on
Juvenal are numerous and regular, with the exception that in
Satire ii. 86-92 they cease altogether, and those which follow
have been added, probably not long after, by another hand.

About a hundred years later another hand added the lives of
Juvenal on the last folio which appears in O. Jahn's edition
(Berlin, 1851). This commentator corrected the mistakes of
the ‘prima manus,' in many places rendering the latter almost

illegible. He followed in his emendations a MS. of an inferior
class ; Beer, however, has been able in every case to discrimi-

nate between the readings of the ‘prima’ and ‘secunda
manus!
