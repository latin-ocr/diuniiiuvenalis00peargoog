SATIRE XII.

reginae, the queen of the gods, Juno, worshipped in the Capitoline .
emple under the title of ‘Iuno Regina! Her common victims were
cows: geese were kept in her temple in memory os the alarm they gave
on the occasion of the attack by the Gauls.

4. vellus, ironical; he seems to imply that the gods cannot really
care about the spirit of the sacrifice; they valued the victim for itswool
only. In the same way, pugnanti Gorgone Maura seems to be
a satirical way of speaking os Minerva, who carried on the aegis she
bore the head oi the Gorgon Medusa, which tumed its beholders into
stone. cf. Ov. Met. iv. ‘Gorgo‘ is used absolutely ior the shield, on
which the Gorgon's head is depicted. Pallas is represented as shooting
lightning in Verg. Aen. i. 4²· For Domitian’s special worship os
Minerva see Suet. Dom. 15.

5. The animal goes quietly, sor the rope is trailing at length, and he
needs not to be dragged, which would have been a bad omen. Pliny, H.N.
viii. 45. cf. Macrob. Sat. iii. 5· ‘observatum est a sacrificantibus, ut si
hostia quae ad aras duceretur suisset vehementius reluctata, ostendissetqne
se invitam altaribus amoveri, amoveretur, quia invito deo offerri eam
putabant! Cf. also Hor. Od. iii. 13. 3 sqq.

petulans, from ‘peto,' is the regular word ior ‘butting ;' κορῦττειν
Theoc. iii. 5. Cs. Verg. Ec. iii. 87 ‘Iam comu petat et pedibus qui
spargat arenam.' Cf. ‘hostia petulans’ Petron. in Satir. 9²·

6. Tarpeio. ‘Mons Tarpeius‘ was the ancient name os the Capitol.

7. quippe has developed from a mere interrogative into a causal
conjunction; but its meaning is not so decided as that of ‘ enim’

8. spargendus mererady sor his baptism of wine,' which was

poured on the head of the vrctim before it was killed. Cf. Verg. Aen.
’ iv. 61, Ov. Met. vii. 593. He seems to have in mind Horace, Od.
¹¹· ²· 53 Sqq·

9. ‘Who gores the oaks with his budding hom.’ cf. Verg. Georg.
iii. 25² ‘irasci in cornua discit!

10.aimilie=par. The word ‘affectus’ in the plural is stronger
than the same word in the singular, which is itsels a strong word for
‘love’ It denotes ‘an imperious bent of the soul. sometimes as strong
as “amon'' but not generally as lasting aud acknowledged’ See Abel,
‘The conception os Love in some ancient and modern Languages’ p. 62.

11. Hispulla, a stout lady.. cf. vi. 74. He cannot refrain from
a jest at the popular religion, though he has no desire to see that
religion abolished; in fact. he is always ready to carry out the
formalities prescribed hythe old religion under which Rome grew to
greatness‚ buthe cannot bear the new innovations from the East.

13. The Clitumnus in Umbria was supposed to have the power os
turning the cattle which browsed on its banks white, and white cattle
were most prized for sacrifice. Cf. Verg. Georg. ii. 146 and Propertius,
ii. 19. 25 ‘Qua formosa suo Clitumnus flumina luco Integit et niveos
abluit unda boves,‘ and Pliny, H. N. ii. 103, who describes the water in
the ager Faliscus as having the same property. cf. also claudian, VI.
