LIFE OF JUVENAL. 33

narrative or argumentative parts strong in a severe concision
and only now and again rising, as if under protest, to the point
at which passion is appealed to. Juvenal not unfrequently
is the first to laugh at his own vehemence. He recapitu-
lates all the infamies of Rome, and says that indignation
inspires verses, ‘such asi can write. . .or Cluvienus! He
tums from a vigorous apostrophe, recapitulating what the
plebeian Decii and Numa had done, to a pithy suggestion that
every patrician is descended from a shepherd or a selon. The
noble‘hurst with which the second Satire concludes is carried
on with undiminished fire and elevation, till the poet arrives
at the sentiment that the conquered nations have a severer
morality than the conquerors. At that point it may well be that
Juvenal was embarrassed by his own success. To complete
the passage without declining into a platitude, might seem as
difficultas it has proved for modern art to determine how the
missing arms ol the Venus of Melos ought to be restored. Ac-
cordingly the satirist drops at once into a cynical sneer at a
single degrading episode of contemporary scandal. Itis notice-
ahle that in the third and tenth Satires, which have been very
carefully finished, this artifice is never employed, auditis less
and less general in the later poems. There is an exception in
the thirteenth satire, where a fine picture of the bad man’s
questionings whether he may not risk offending the gods since
their mills grind slowly‚ is succeeded by a grotesque picture ol
the despoiled man’s wrath and of the complaints hurled atheaven
forits ineffectual justice. On the whole, the third Satire, with its

equable flow and serene dignity, may be regarded as marking
the highest level which Juvenal attained, and its success may
seem conclusive against the rapid transitions of the other early
Satires. lt must be borne in mind, however, that' as a rule the
pieces first in order are superior to those which are supposed to be
later in time, and the precise faults charged against these, a turgid
declamatorydiction andastilted morality,may reasonably be held
referable to the difficulties of keeping the style always intense.

The better side ofeloquence comes out now and again when . .

Juvenal animates a tame thought with a spirited apostrophe or
a vivid illustration. Nothing can be more correct or unim-
passioned than the sentiment that the tutor ought to take the
