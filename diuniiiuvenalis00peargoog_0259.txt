SATIRE XI.

136. ‘I have no carver, the champion ofthc carving school, a disciple
os the great professor Trypherus (as we might say M. Le Gonrmand)
who teaches sarving on wooden models till the Subura rings with the
datter! The ‘pergulae magistrales' were open booths attached to oer-
tain houses in Rome where different arts were taught. Cf. Suet. Gr. 18.

138. pygargus=‘antilopa pygargus!

159. Scythicae volucres, ‘phasianae’ Athenaeus 14 quotes a pas·
sage from the writings οἰ the Egyptian king Ptolemy Euergetes 11,
‘these birds, called τέταροι (the same word as ‘ tetrao '), were not merely
acclimatised from Media, but artificially bred for the table? An edict
οἱ Diocletian's prescribes the market price alike of the wild and of the
tame birds.

142. Afrae avis, ¹ the guinea sowl' (Numida meleagris), very common
in North-West Africa, as is attested by Speke and Niebuhr. Varro
calls them ‘gallinae Africanae' iii. 9. 18. With the decay of the
Roman empire these birds went out os fashion and were heard of no
more till the Portuguese introduced them airesh from Africa. Cf. Hehu
P· 294·

144. imbutus. ‘He is only just initiated into petty larcenies'

146. ‘A rough boy well clad in home-spun; not dressed up like an
Asiatic Ganymede!

147. non a mangone petitus. Ribbeck holds these and the follow-
ing words to be spurious-down to ‘magna'

mango. cf. Martial i. 59 ‘Millia pro puero centum me
mango poposcit.' The word comes from the root ‘mag' found in
μαγγανεύω, ‘to deceive or cajole by magical arts,' and so to adulterate
or put off bad wares. Cf. English ‘monger·';' German ‘menger' in
Fischmenger. Slave-dealers were proverbially triclry. Cf. Cic. de
Offic. iii. 27. 51.

148. ⁴ He is no Greek, so you must talk tc him in good Latin.²

149· The slaves are in no classes cr familiae. but all wear the same
simple costume3 their hair is close cut and uncurled; they are no dan·
dies like those described by Cicero, Catiline ii. 22 ‘pexo capillo
nitidi! cf. also Mart. iii. 58.

152. suspirat, used transitively‚ is post-classical.

154. Macleane rightly remarks that there is a play upon ingenuus
here3 he says he has a frank modesty such as the boys of an ‘in-
genuus’ should have.

r 55. quos ardens purpura, i. e. the ‘praetextati,’ or sons of free
citizens. ' .

159· diffusa, ‘bottled off ' from the ‘dolium' into the ‘amphora'
The wines are the wines cl the country, not expensive wines from South
Italy or Greece.

roa-182. Now contrast the simplicity cf a meal like this with the
prodigality of the ‘symposia' in town.

162. Gaditana. Some editors tale this as equivalent to ⁴ Gaditana
carmina,’ and as the nom. to ‘incipiant‘ Others (as Weidner) take
