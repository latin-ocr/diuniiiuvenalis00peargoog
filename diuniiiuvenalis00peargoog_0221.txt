Ι offer, that his father mayhear him as often as I have to do.’ Weidner
alters the text to ‘Quantum vis stipulare? en protinus accipet quin do, ut
totiens illum pater audiat! ‘How much do yon wish to bargain forl
Take it on the spot, nay, 1 give it you, if only his father: etc. Bnt

Mayor's reading does less violence to the reading of the Mss, and gives
an equally good sense.

166. ‘This is the complaint of half a dozen rhetoricians who leave
their fancy themes and conduct true cases'

168. raptore relicto. Quintilian refers to thisas a fancy theme in
his Decl. 247. A rich young man runs away with a girl. He offers
to marry her: she refuses. He stabs himself. Then the girl offers to
accept him as a husband before he dies. Then the wife and the husband’s
relations put in claims to the inheritance.

169. The substance of the second stock theme is given by Seneca,
Contr. ii. 13.

170. The substance of this ‘controversia' is not known.

171. ‘He will give himself his discharge.' A metaphor drawn from
the gladiatorial school. The gladiator, on receiving his discharge,
received as a present the wooden sword with which he practised. Cf.
Hor. Ep. i. 1. a.

173. ab umbra, from ‘the cloistered retirement' of the rhetorician, re·
ferring to the rhetorician’s ‘vita umbratilis‚’ aa distinguished from the
real battle of life.

174, The sense according to Mayor is, ‘Who' comes into court from
his retirement to recover from his scholars the paltry pittance they owe,
amounting to at most the price of a corn ticket.’ Weidner interprets the
passage, ‘ Whoever is wise will give up playing the rhetoi, so that he
may at least in his right of civis get his breed-ticket, which he sells for
a paltry price. This is however better than nothing at all.' In the
later times of the republic and under Augustus a quantity of cheap
bread-tickets were issued to certain of the poorer class at Rome, by the
‘praefectus annonae? These tesserae were guaranteed bytho State and
were transferable. The presenter of such ‘tessera’ would receive
a ‘modius' for ⁶1¹1 asses, the market price being 12 asses. If he were
known to be a rhetor, and so capable of gaining his living, he would
not receive the ‘tessera' It seems that the simplest way to take the
words is, ‘I would advise the rhetorician who would turn lawyer to
enter on some quite different career· from either, that is, if he would
keep in his pocket the paltry fee which he has gained as rhetorician.’

175. ‘Examine the sees which music masters such as Chrysogonus and
Polio get, and yon will tear up your treatise on rhetoric' The first two
were professors of music: Polio is referred to as such in Martial iv. 61. 9.

177. Theodorus of Gadara is praised by Quintilian iii. 1. 17.

178. ‘Your rich man must have every luxury: bathi, porticoes,
antistes: he can afford only a trifle to the best rhetoriciansff Pliny's
description of his villa (ii. 17) should be read in connection with
this.
