and inherit the guilty thoughts. In both these cases we get only
‘one religion of the family. But in the tenth, and above all in the

sthirteenth Satire, we find a really sublime faith systematized.
Juvenal never attains altogether to the scientific level. He sees
that it is irrational and wrong to pray that the orderof the world
may be changed for a man’s personal advantage, but heis not
sure that the mind is not external to the universe, and that the
soul may nothe supematurally transformed by the intervention
of the gods. Neither is he quite ,a Christian. He does not
desire the reformation of the sinner or believe it possible, but he
rejoices in the idea that a had man will be tortured hy con-
science, and that, as character is bound to run its course out, he
will sooner or later plunge into overt crime and incur the penalty
of the law. With these abatements, however, Juvenal’s is a very
high morality. He denounces revenge3 he declares that the
thought of sin is sin itself ; he reprobates the passion for wealth3
he sees clearly that the only path of a peaceful life lies through ·
integrity3 and that the highest wisdom is to be true to ourselves
(xiv. 321). Further he denounces masters who are cruel towards .
their slaves (xiv. 19). lf internal evidence goes for anything, the
moral advance perceptible in these latter Satires would indicate
that they belong to Juvenal’s old age.

It has sometimes seemed as if Juvenal—himselfa provincial
of the middle classes-was extravagant in the importance he
attached to the claims oi birth. An abstract statement that he
prefers Achilles the son of Thersites to Thersites the son of
Achilles, cannot outweigh the numerous passages in which the '
poet denounces the unworthy pursuits of patricians as the last
portent of evil times. The declaimer‚ not the moralist, appears
to speak when Juvenal declares that Lentulus, who acted a

Ι crucifixion on the stage, ought to have been crucified in earnest;
or that the gladiator compelled to fight with Gracchus endured
adisgrace which was worse than any wound. Nevertheless‚ if
we test the poet hy his contemporaries it will be found that his
point oi view is that to which the historian appeals, and that

, which was generally deemed conclusive. Personal self-respect,
'the sense of personal dignity united to the hereditary feeling of

f the obligations of patriciam birth, had been the secret of the
