the Republic; though' the relationship indicated by these words
had its origin in the later times of the Republic. In those times
political life demanded that public men should have a large fol·
lowing, which should be manifest to the public in the shape of
‘salutatores' ‘deductores’ and ‘assectatores' Prominent poli·
ticians drew such followers to themselves by services rendered,
and by acts of kindness and hospitality, demanding, however,
from these in return their good offices in the critical times of
election. To this following belonged clients, libertini, and slaves,
as well as fellow tribesmen and dependents on noble families:
for the more show the public man made the larger amount of
credit did he win. With the empire the political significance
of the great man’s following was lost; but it was still deemed
mean and disgraceful in a public manto appear in public
without a following suitable to his rank (Juv. vii. 142). Dis-

that it was based upon reciprocal service. ldlers, poeta, cheva-
liers dz'ndustrzt, poor epicures, legacy·hunters, decayed noble-
men, senators, and consulars, together with crowds of genuine
beggars, out at elbows and out at heels, found it convenient to
sacrifice their personal freedom and to become hangers·on to a
great man on the chance of some windfall bringing thern a rise
in the world, or in search of their daily bread.
’ The consequence of this unnatural system was for public
morality very grave. Piety, the motive which inspired the
old ‘clientela’ disappeared, and was replaced by a false pride
ori the part of patron and dependant alike. The patron loves
the display of his retinue : the client boasts that he has as many
