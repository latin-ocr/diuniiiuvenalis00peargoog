87. The sense is, they were born cannibals:¹ the first who tasted
the human flesh thought it was the daintiest of morsels: we shudder

got any pleasure out of it: nay, I answer the last, who drained the last
drops os blood, had as much pleasure as the first.

peninsula, in the modern Navarre. Thur town Calagurris-the modern
Calahorra-on the upper Ebro, held out in the cause of Sertorius, and

north os Spain, includingtheBasque territory; and‘ Cantaber' is even

110. He calls Rome ‘nostrae Athenae’ as being not merely the
