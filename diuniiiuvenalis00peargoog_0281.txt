SATIRE XIV.

tradunt, by their false teaching.

5. bullatus. See Satire v. 164. The bulla was the amnlet which was
laid aside with the ‘toga praetexta,’ and dedicated to the Lares.
Juvenal regards the dice-play as a battle, ci. Sat. i. 91, 92.

6. And the son oi the glutton leads you to expect that you will find
gluttony developed in him as surely as you will find the spirit of ’
gambling developed in theson ol the gambler.

7. radere tubera, i. e. to dig truffies.

9. mergere, ‘to sense} not, as Weidner takes it, ‘ventre vel gula?

10. cana gula. ‘ Canns’ refers to the ‘glutton,' the idea of which is
contained in ‘gula'

12. barbatos, because it was the custom of philosophers to grow
lbeir heard-⁴ pascere barbam? Hence Persius iv. 1 speaks oi Socrates
as ‘barbatum magistrum‘

¹5· Then again, in the matter os cruelty, do you think that a son who
has grown up with the example of a Rutilus before his eyes can ever
grow up humane? aequus is said of one who looks indulgently upon
small ianlts, Hor. Sat. i. 3.118.

17. Rutilus is the subject of praecipit and putat.

19. ‘No siren song is to him so sweet as the sound os the lasb.’

no. He is a true Antiphates, as bad as the king os the Laestrygones
in Homer, Odyssey x. 80; a regular cannibal.

aa. duo propter lintea. ‘All ior a couple os napkins stolen)

24. inscripta ergastula. ‘The branded gangs.’ ‘Er-gastula’ sor
‘slaves,’ as ‘servitia’ for ‘servi' ‘Inscriptio frontis' was commonly
the punishment of runaway slaves only.

mire adficiunt, ‘strike with peculiar admiration?

25. rusticus expectas. The language oi Horace, Ep. 1. a. 42, is
,in his mind, though the thought is different.

31. ‘Home examples affect us more than others, seeing that (oum)
their authority is so weighty.'

35. praecordia. The heart as the seat of conscience as well as that
ol intellect. Cs. Sat. i. 167.

Titan, i· e. Prometheus, son oi the Titan Iapetus. Ci. ‘Satus
Iapeto,' Ov. Met. i. 82. In Met. i. 395 Pyrrha is called ‘ Titania,' as
daughter oi Epimetheus. Juvenal seems to have in his mind Horace,
Odes i. 16. 13 ‘Fertur Prometheus addere principi Limo coactus parti-
culam undique Desectam)

36. ‘The sootsteps which should serve them as a waming what to
avoid, do, aa a fact, serve them as a guide'

37. orbita. The wheel track, and thus the path.

Greek we should here expect the article.

39. ‘For such abstinence there is at least one powersnl reason.'

4²· Quocumque would more naturally be ‘quovis'

We are all so ready to follow bad examples that a monster civice
is common, a paragon ol virtue a rarity.
