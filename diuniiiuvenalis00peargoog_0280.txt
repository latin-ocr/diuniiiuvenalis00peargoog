wars, lived contented on their freeholds of two acres to a family-not
enough for a garden now, but then enough for the owner, his wife and
children and slave; ay, and to furnish supper for their big brothers,
il.156-171. It is this wish for large properties that incites to great
· crimes, 11. 172-178. Our Samnite and Sabellian fathers understood
this, aud urged their sons to be content with the rough sheepskin for
dress, and with the corn from their own furrows for bread, ll. 179—188.
Now the father calls up his son at midnight and bids him train to be‘a
lawyer, a soldier, or a commission agent, ll. 189-205. No one cares
how the money is got, provided it is there, ll. ²05·²09· I might tell ‘a
parent of this stamp not to trouble himself, his instructions are certain
to be bettered by his children, who, as they grow up, will seek for gold,
though it be by perjuries and private assassinations, ll. alo-224. Yon

great estate, you cannot put limits to the means of acquiring it, ll. 2²5-

destroy every unselfish and patriotic sentiment, ll. ²35-243· Last of all
your own horoscope will be taken, and your son will mingle poison for
you, ll. 244-2 55.

It is better than a play to watch the dangers that are incurred for
money-making, ll. 256-264. The man who earns his living ou the right
rope does not court death more than the merchant, who lets himself be ’
sturm-tost that he may increase his wealth, ll. 265-275. Yet the sea
is covered with argosies, that you may fill your money-begs, and boast of
the wonders seen, ll. 275—283. There are different forms of lunacy, and
though you have no insane delusion‚ and do not rend your clothes like -
Orestes or Ajax, you commit equal maduess when you run the chance of
beggary or death in a loaded ship on a stormy sea, 284-302·

It is as difficult to keep what you have got asto get it. The cynic
