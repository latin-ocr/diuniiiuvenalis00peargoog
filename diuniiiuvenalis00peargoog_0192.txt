SATIRE IV: INTRODUCTION.

306. ‘As soon as ever the Pomptine Marshes and Gallinarian pine-
wood are cleared of robbers, these all betake themselves hither, as ii this
was their natural femiisg-ground! Augustus attempted to draiu the
Pomptine Marshes in Latium. The Gallinarian pine-wood was near
Cumae, a well-known haunt oi banditti.

309. The order is ‘Qua iomace, qua incude, non graves catenael'

310. modus. ‘The greatest quantity oi iron goes ior letters? so that
one well may sear that none will be leit for spades aud hoes.

314. uno carcere. The Mamertiue prison, in the district called the
Lautumiae, beyond the Argiletum to the N.W. oi the Forum, said by
Livy, i. 33, to have been built by Ancus Martius. See Burn (Rome
and the Campagna p. 80), who also explains the word ‘Tullianum'
which was alleged to have been a dungeon added by Servius Tullius,
as in reality meaning the ‘well-house,’ irorn an old word ‘tullius’
meaning a ‘projection oi water.⁸

318. ‘As often as you come irum Rome to Aquinum, I will come and

stay with you' Juvenal was a native oi Aquinum, aud probably had ⁴

some property there near the shrine oi Ceres and Diana.
Helvia, the name of a Roman gens—it is otherwise unknown.
32²· P reads ‘auditor ³—the reading adopted. He means, 1 will come
as a hearer who has not yet lost his love for country simplicity in con·
trast to the spoilt and effeminate ‘auditores‘ in Rome; as men leave
the heat in Rome (augusto mense) Iwill prepare to brook the cold in
the country.

SA'HRE IV.
Α ROllAL T URBOT.

THE i'ourth Satire, which stands by itself as a story told in verse, con-
sists osan introduction, ll. 1-363 a narrative, ll. 37-1493 and a perora·
tion, ll. 150—154. Itis quite possible that the introduction as lar as l. 27
belonged originally to another poem, which was chiefly directed against
Crispinus. The argument, ‘ii Crispinus was a glutton‚ what must the
Emperor have beeol’ is rather too forced to have been intended as the
opening passage oi a singularly vivid description. Again, the burial oi
the vestal‚ alluded to in ll. 9 and 10 as ‘nuper,’ occurred in ll. 89 or 91 ;
the latter part ol the poem attacking Domitian himself can hardly have
been written till Nerva's reign, ll. 96-98. It is difficult to say what real
story the Satire refers to. It would seem as ii it must apply to Cornelia,
the only vestal who was buried alive ; but it is doubtful ii she was guilty
at all, and her supposed paramour was Licianus, who confessed to save
his life, and was banished to Sicily. Licianus, a Roman oi rank, a
scholar, and disgraced, cannot have been Crispinus, an Egyptian, an up

start, and who remained powersul. Perhaps Juvenal believed that Cor·
nelia was guilty, and that Crispinus was her real seducer. Suetonius
implies that she had had several intrigues.
