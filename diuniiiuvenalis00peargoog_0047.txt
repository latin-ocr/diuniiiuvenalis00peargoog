40 INTRODUCTION. .

Boileau by a charming refinement makes his ‘ preeieuse' com·
pare Vergil and Chapelain, remark a great many delects in
Vergil, and findno fault in Chapelain‚ except that it is impossible
to read him¹. Then again Boileau‚ the contemporary of Monere,
had the advantage ol living in au age which had detected,
though it did not create, the religious hypocrite, and his descrip·
tion of the priest·governed woman is not only deeper and more
vivid than Juvenal's of the votary ol Isis, but opens up a new
world in the human heart.

On the whole it is surely justifiable to say that Juvenal with
all his faults stands in the very front rank ol satirists, and was
theone true poet of his own day.

¹ ‘Ne trouve en Chapelain‚ quoi qu'ait dit la Satine,
Autre detaut, sinon, qu’on ne le saurait lire,
Et pour faire gollter son livre a l'Univers
Croit qu'il faudrait en prose y mettre tous les vers?
